    <h2>
      I&mdash;BEING THE STRUGGLE OF AN AMATEUR AUTHOR TO GET A FAIR START
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>PEAKING of money&mdash;and
      it&rsquo;s a mighty popular topic&mdash;the investment of the first twenty-five
      cents I ever earned, all at a crack, ought to have directed my feet, my
      thoughts, and my future along the straight and narrow way. Ten minutes
      after I had galloped gleefully home with that quarter-dollar from Judge
      Kingsley&rsquo;s hay-field, my good mother led me down to Old Maid Branscombe&rsquo;s
      little book-store and obliged me to buy a catechism.
    </p>
    <p>
      I earned that money by hauling a drag-rake for a whole day around behind a
      hay-cart, barefoot and kicking against the vicious stubbles of the shaven
      field. I honestly felt that I did not deserve the extra penance of the
      catechism. However, that first day&rsquo;s work gave me my earliest respect for
      money&mdash;earned money. And I also remember that Judge Kingsley, when he
      paid me, sniffed and said I hadn&rsquo;t done enough to earn twenty-five cents.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hated to walk up to him and ask for my pay, because Celene Kingsley was
      within hearing; she had come down to the field to fetch him home in her
      pony-chaise. That&rsquo;s right! You&rsquo;ve guessed it! I&rsquo;ll waste no words. It was
      only another of the old familiar cases. Barefooted, folks poor, keeping my
      face toward her, as a sunflower fronts the sun (though the sunflower has
      other reasons than hiding patches), I was in the shamed, secret, hopeless,
      heartaching agonies of a fifteen-year-old passion. Of course, I don&rsquo;t mean
      that I had loved her for all that time&mdash;I&rsquo;m giving my age and hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I hated to walk up. And the judge gave me the quarter only because he
      did not have any smaller change.
    </p>
    <p>
      And really, for the times, it was considerable of a coin for a single
      juvenile job.
    </p>
    <p>
      The services of youngsters in those days in Levant were paid for on a
      narrower scale&mdash;ten cents for lawns and a nickel for shoveling snow,
      and so on. And tin-peddlers were mighty stingy in their dickerings for old
      rubbers and junk. To get rags one had to steal &rsquo;em&mdash;our folks
      made rugs and guarded old remnants carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for my first financial adventure of real moment&mdash;for the
      biggest coin I had ever clutched; and right now I lay down my pen for a
      moment and spread out two human paws which have juggled three million
      dollars&rsquo; worth of gold ingots as carelessly as one scruffles jackstraws.
      That was maverick treasure. But there&rsquo;s a big difference between earned
      money and maverick money. If you don&rsquo;t know what maverick means I&rsquo;ll save
      you the trouble of looking the word up in the dictionary. Once on a time,
      in Texas, old Sam Maverick wouldn&rsquo;t brand his cattle. Therefore, a
      maverick was a cow or steer unbranded. And to-day it means any kind of
      property at large which a bold man or a dishonest man may grab if he can
      beat other thieves to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had an early taste of maverick money, and the taste was so sweet that I
      never have lost my hankering for more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fall of that &ldquo;year of the catechism&rdquo; the line gale blew down the
      chimney which had stood after the old Pratt house was burned. I was there
      before the dust settled, for all the boys knew that there were
      wrought-iron clamps high up in the bricks. But I left the clamps to the
      next comers and picked up a dented tin box, rusty and dusty and
      soot-blackened; I shook it; it rattled and I ran away into the woods. When
      I had knocked the box open and looked in and spied coins I had the
      heart-thrilling conviction that money worries were over for me in this
      life. My first thought was that I would marry Celene Kingsley and settle
      down and live happy ever after. If there had been in the box what I
      thought at first there was, I could wipe my pen and close my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dove both hands into the box and brought them up brimming&mdash;coins
      scattering and clattering back over my trembling fingers. They were big
      coins&mdash;and I had read much about the days of the bold pirates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pieces of eight!&rdquo; I whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they were not. When I had winked the mist out of my eyes I found that
      they were old-fashioned coppers&mdash;bung-downs they used to be called.
      Mixed in with them were a few copper tokens, a Pine Tree shilling, a
      sprinkling of Speed The Plow cents, and the only coin of any account at
      all was a Mexican dollar with a hole in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn&rsquo;t in my nature to bury that treasure. I knew it was pretty
      worthless junk, but I had a hankering to carry it about with me, to feel
      its drag in my pockets, to reach in and chink it when no one could hear. I
      walked around weighted with it as afterward I have been weighted with the
      leaden chunks of my diver&rsquo;s dress. As early as that in my life I found
      that money was a burden as well as a vexation. I didn&rsquo;t dare to frisk and
      frolic with the boys at school; I was not exploiting my new wealth; I had
      grounds for caution because there were plenty of Pratts left in Levant. At
      home I moved about so quietly that my folks thought, I reckon, that I was
      entering an early decline. My mother used to look at my tongue quite often
      and made me drink hardhack tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is one impulse in the male animal which is not easily controlled
      by prudence; it&rsquo;s that cursed itch to make a show in front of the female
      of the species&mdash;in front of the special one, the selected one, the
      beloved one. Some sort of a jimcrack-peddler came into the school-yard one
      noon, and Celene Kingsley, daughter of a plutocrat, tendered a big, shiny
      silver dollar and the man could not change it for her. I walked up,
      trembling with both pride and panic, and said, trying my best to act the
      part of a matter-of-fact bank on two legs, &ldquo;Let me handle it for you!&rdquo; It
      was the first time I had ever spoken to her, and my voice was only a weak
      squawk.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she turned to me and opened her big, blue eyes, I was nigh to running
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys and girls came crowding around, and I couldn&rsquo;t blame them for
      showing interest; the sight of a Levant Sidney with money on him was a new
      one in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had separated from the coppers the aristocrats of my hoard, the Pine
      Tree shilling and the Mexican dollar, by wrapping them in a wisp of paper.
      I brought them out first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly what they are worth in real money,&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;But
      you can have &rsquo;em at half price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had been considerably surprised before, but now she was plain
      dumfounded. That system of changing a dollar was brand new.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I dredged a trousers pocket and produced a handful of the bung-down
      coppers. I began to count them down on a corner of the school-house steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody get a wheelbarrow,&rdquo; advised one of the boys. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only
      way she&rsquo;ll ever tug-a-lug her change home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, you needn&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; she said, stammering a little. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t
      trouble yourself. I have changed my mind about buying anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t money,&rdquo; said the jimcrack man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never take that stuff for
      my goods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A girl ran up and grabbed into the coppers I had been, heaping on the
      stone. She was a Pratt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ross Sidney, you stole that money,&rdquo; she squealed. &ldquo;It was in my granny&rsquo;s
      notion-box. We couldn&rsquo;t find it after she died. You stole it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t steal it&mdash;I found it,&rdquo; I told her. But all the courage had
      gone out of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t the first thief to lie about your stealings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I did find it&mdash;I found it after the chimney blew down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew it was ours. You didn&rsquo;t bring it to us&mdash;that&rsquo;s stealing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might have been put there before&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my granny&rsquo;s money. Don&rsquo;t you suppose I know? She saved old
      coppers.&rdquo; She spread down her handkerchief and began to pile the coins
      upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There did not seem to be any room for argument. In my shame I fell to
      wondering how I had ever convinced myself that this money was
      treasure-trove. I dug down and gave her the rest of it. Instead of proudly
      showing myself a person of means before Celene Kingsley I was. barely
      escaping the suspicion of being a thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it belongs to the Pratts you&rsquo;re welcome to it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
      anything which belongs to somebody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better remember as much the next time you find money,&rdquo; snapped the
      Pratt girl. &ldquo;Your conscience will be easier when you die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They say that dying men live over their lives in a. flash&mdash;that&rsquo;s so!
      When I was dying in black darkness, five fathoms deep under the waters of
      the Pacific, with a bar of gold in either hand, I remembered what that
      Pratt girl said to me that day in the glory of the autumn sunshine, my
      face as red as a frost-touched leaf; it was the day of my bitterest
      humiliation; I slunk off without daring to look at Celene Kingsley.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I know what my main mistake was in my first attempts at writing
      this tale; I tried to tell the story as if it had happened to somebody
      else and the thing was stiffer than a mud-caked tug-line and squealed like
      a rusty windlass. Of course, I hate to be saying &ldquo;I&rdquo; here, there, and
      everywhere&mdash;but there&rsquo;ll come a place in my tale&mdash;you&rsquo;ll think
      of it if ever you get as far as that&mdash;where there&rsquo;d be nothing to the
      story unless you could see with my eyes and feel with my hands. So, bear
      with me and I&rsquo;ll reel off the yarn as best I know how, making no apologies
      after this confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, about that first maverick money I ran afoul of! I never saw that money
      again, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I did happen to meet Ben Pratt right in front of Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s
      house. I&rsquo;ll not say how big Ben Pratt was, because you&rsquo;ll think this is
      only a bragging story. He called me a thief and I decided it was about
      time to show Levant that the name was not a popular one with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I licked him:
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Kingsley rushed out with a horsewhip and lashed us apart just as I
      was finishing Ben up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Sidney, you&rsquo;re a cheeky, tough, brazen character,&rdquo; said the judge.
      I did not answer him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is my nature to take a big lot from all women, considerable from some
      men, and devilish little from most men. I had nothing at all to say to
      Celene Kingsley&rsquo;s father, even though I was rubbing half a dozen swelling
      welts where his whip had connected with the back of my neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come of a tough family,&rdquo; stated the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right then my uncle Deck arrived at the party; he had been watching the
      thing from the tavern porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say about our family?&rdquo; he asked the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to stand here and quarrel with you, Decker Sidney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you horsewhip my dead brother&rsquo;s boy in the main street you&rsquo;ll come
      pretty nigh to having a quarrel with me, seeing that his own father can&rsquo;t
      protect him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I merely came out here and stopped a fight which was disgracing our
      village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice thing for one of the &lsquo;forty thieves&rsquo; to talk about disgracing
      a village,&rdquo; said my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      As young as I was I knew what was meant when folks called Judge Kinglsey
      one of the forty thieves. He belonged to the syndicate that had grabbed
      the State&rsquo;s principal railroad away from the original shareholders; there
      was political shenanigan and a good deal of foreclosure trickery. I never
      understood the details, but the fact remained that the syndicate got the
      railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cheap slur from a cheap man,&rdquo; said the judge, walking away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can&rsquo;t say that I resented that remark very deeply, though I suppose
      family loyalty should have prompted me to do so. I never in my life came
      close to my uncle Deck when he did not have the smell of liquor on his
      breath: On each side of his nose there was a patch of perfectly lurid
      crimson. He was a horse-trader and he made considerable money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That slur of <i>yours</i> is a high-priced one,&rdquo; my uncle shouted. &ldquo;I
      have my eye on you, you old hypocrite. There&rsquo;ll come a day when that slur
      will cost you more than you can afford to pay. That&rsquo;s how high-priced it
      is, Judge Kingsley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t know what my uncle meant then.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wicked time for me when I did find out, a long while afterward.

    <h2>
      II&mdash;ENDING WITH A MEETING ON PURGATORY HILL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>Y mother was a
      good woman&mdash;a thrifty, kindly, helpful woman, a good neighbor, in
      spite of her poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      My short temper, my cheeky disposition, my generally ready impulse to grab
      in on short notice, all belong to the Sidney side, I guess. All we know of
      the family has come down by word of mouth, and I suspect that the first
      rovers who came over in the old days when New England was really new were
      pretty tough characters who had plenty of original nerve to start with and
      then developed more as occasion required. Well, some of that sort had to
      come on ahead and smooth things with the ax and crowbar&mdash;yes, and
      with the musket, so that the country could get a good running start.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother was a good neighbor, I repeat. Up in the attic, hanging in dried
      bunches from the beams, were spearmint, thoroughwort, hardback, mullein,
      pennyroyal, and other pasture herbs which she sent me forth to gather. Her
      thoroughwort syrup was guaranteed to cure any case of whooping-cough&mdash;and
      she gave freely to all who came to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father was a helpful sort of a man in his own way. He used to volunteer
      as boss of all the barn-raising bees in our section&mdash;but his enemies,
      made up of a considerable army of the men whom he had licked in his life,
      said, behind his back, that the only reason he had for helping at a
      barn-raising was to show off by running the ridgepole first of all the
      crew, and then to start the regular free fight. He fell off a ridge-pole
      one day and my mother was widowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I take it that her chief ambition in life was to tame the Sidney
      disposition in me&mdash;that earnest desire explaining my involuntary
      investment in the catechism. My mother&rsquo;s axioms and teachings would have
      made excellent addenda and foot-notes for any catechism. Always did she
      counsel me to count ten before speaking angry word or performing angry
      act; I don&rsquo;t remember that I ever did as she told me, though the Lord
      Himself knows how much I have suffered in my life on account of that lack
      of self-restraint. Two days after I bought the catechism my good mother
      thought it was having its effect on my nature. She saw a boy heave a rock
      at me in our door-yard and I stood perfectly motionless and speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, my own son! Count your ten!&rdquo; she called to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just at that moment a bumblebee was crawling around over my bare foot
      and I was in no mind to disturb him. Therefore, my enemy was enabled to
      collect a full supply of rock ammunition and to defy and rout me when at
      last I was free from the restraint of the bumblebee. It would have been
      the same if I had waited to count ten. Somehow, as the world is
      constituted, I have never taken much stock in this watchful-waiting game
      while your enemy is hustling to pile up his ammunition and you know he is
      doing so. I may be wrong. Maybe this story of mine will show that I&rsquo;m
      wrong. But I hear you say, let&rsquo;s get on to the story!
    </p>
    <p>
      I mean to do so at once; but if I have paused to pull the curtain aside
      from my family and my character a bit you may be able to understand some
      parts of the story a mite better, because, in spite of that catechism, in
      spite of mother-influence, and perhaps mother-goodness deep down in me, I
      have butted into adventures which you will not find set down in the
      volumes of any well-conducted Sunday-school library.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t have my mother long, after my fifteenth birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was her sole heir; five minutes before she closed her eyes she gave me
      all her little fortune&mdash;to wit, the sweetest smile good mother ever
      left to bless memory of her, a pat on my hand, a few whispered words in my
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Uncle Deck took me in hand to make a man of me, so he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wasn&rsquo;t all bad&mdash;don&rsquo;t understand me as saying that. He would pass
      a sleepless night if he failed to cheat a man in a horse trade, but he
      would sell his shirt before he would allow any old folks in our town to go
      onto the poor-farm. He would sneak around with wood and groceries after
      dark, that big, red face of his like a harvest moon, and when they would
      start to thank him he would curse the miserable old creatures so horribly
      that my blood used to run cold. He prided himself on language which, so he
      said, &ldquo;would break up a Sunday-school picnic if a little bird sat overhead
      and twittered it out of a tree.&rdquo; He saved his choicest profanity for his
      comments on Judge Zebulon Kingsley. His hatred went far back. I don&rsquo;t know
      what started it. Perhaps it began in the natural antipathy such a man as
      Uncle Deck would entertain for a cold, proud, punctilious, professedly
      religious man like the judge. Uncle Deck would have it that the judge was
      a hypocrite, a thief at heart, and my uncle&rsquo;s constant boast was that some
      day he would show the judge up; but all that vaporing seemed to be silly
      spite, without foundation. Judge Kingsley was our rich man; he had been
      judge of probate, and after retiring from that office he was trusted with
      funds as a sort of private banker; folks whose estates he had handled as
      judge just naturally insisted on his keeping control; and he had been town
      treasurer of Levant for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hated to hear my uncle rave on about such a man; it was as irritating as
      the barking of a cur.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said that my uncle was a horse-trader. Rather, he was a general
      country dickerer, if you know the kind. He dealt in everything from a
      sheet of fly-paper to a clap of thunder. He had car-loads of horses sent
      to him from the West and peddled those to farmers, taking cash or bills of
      sale or produce or second-hand furniture or anything else which he could
      turn in a trade. He set me to peddling and collecting, and it was a mean
      job. At first I used to believe everything which debtors or sellers would
      tell me, and the result was that Uncle Deck bawled me out most dreadfully;
      and thus being abused by both parties, I got so at last that I believed
      nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore I was in a fair way to be made just the sort of man Uncle Deck
      desired me to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      And continually, after I was sufficiently hardened, he impressed on me
      that I mustn&rsquo;t be bothering him all the time, asking this and that about
      running the business. I must act for myself and then report to him when he
      called for an accounting. You shall see how his trying to make a man of me
      in this fashion turned me into ways which neither he nor I could have
      forecast. Don&rsquo;t tell me that the activities of this life are very much a
      matter of individual election, after all. To be sure, a man might elect to
      live a hermit and might get away with the job in good shape; but if a
      person throws himself into the ruck of the living, into the running of
      humanity, he&rsquo;ll be apt to find himself leaping from crag to crag because
      he has been shooed or jarred.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran up against one Juvenal Bird, newly come to town from the rural
      fastnesses of Vienna plantation&mdash;plantation meaning an unorganized
      township. I had never heard of Mr. Bird, and when he came within range of
      my vision I rather wondered because I had not; he seemed to be a person of
      some importance. To be sure, his frock suit was rusty and his plug-hat was
      fuzzy, but the garb was distinctive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bird was in search of furniture and I showed him our second-hand
      stock; he ordered liberally and largely&mdash;especially largely. He took
      the biggest stove, the largest bedsteads, the most expansive tables, and
      bureaus of breadth. That plug-hat impressed me. When he told me to send
      the goods out to his house on the Tumble-dick Road, and to call for the
      pay at my convenience, I did not presume to ask for an advance instalment,
      after our usual custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      I promptly found out that this was one affair of business with which I
      should have bothered my busy uncle, who knew all the cheats of the
      section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bird was one of the most notable cheats. His raiment was garb
      discarded by an up-country parson, who pitied Mr. Bird after the latter
      had been evicted from timber-lands as a dangerous squatter, careless of
      fire. Mr. Bird installed the furniture in a shack which he had hired, then
      acted as his own carpenter and narrowed all the doors and the windows. I
      went out after the money and learned that the law provides for the
      replevin of furniture, but does not allow a house to be mutilated in order
      to remove the furniture. Mr. Bird grinned at me through a cracked window
      and thumbed his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I reported to my uncle he told me to go and get it. I refrain from
      quoting the words in which he voiced that command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the law says&mdash;&rdquo; I ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I suppress details. My uncle Deck&rsquo;s opinion of the law would lack
      authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, being a Sidney, and resenting Mr. Bird&rsquo;s betrayal of my
      innocence, and needing a home and a job, I accepted my uncle&rsquo;s opinion of
      the law for the time being. I collected a gang of my boy intimates. We
      went in the night and ripped the stuffing out of Mr. Bird&rsquo;s nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      There&rsquo;s a queer kind of senseless and secret gratification in doing a mob
      job. The human animal has a lot of primeval instincts which need tickling
      once in a while. I reckon we boys gratified the wolf streak on that
      occasion, running in a pack in the night-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      We enjoyed it so much that we held a meeting a night or so later and
      organized ourselves as the &ldquo;Skokums.&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t remember how we happened to
      light on that name. I was chosen as leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      That first sortie was a great success&mdash;Mr. Bird was not in a position
      to prosecute. We had had a wonderful night, had defied the law, and had
      escaped punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Kingsley was the only man in town who proclaimed indignation loudly
      and openly. He expressed himself before a crowd in the post-office and
      declared that hoodlums had disgraced the town of Levant. He looked
      straight at me and said he would give a reward of ten dollars for evidence
      on which the ringleader could be convicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I would give one thousand dollars to pay for law to set him free,&rdquo;
       said my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day the plug-uglies will be rooted out of this place&mdash;and good
      riddance to &rsquo;em,&rdquo; snarled the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The snout that goes rooting into that business will get twisted off&rsquo;n the
      face of the rooter,&rdquo; retorted my uncle. He was never very choice in his
      language. How those crimson patches on his face did glow and how his eyes
      sparkled!
    </p>
    <p>
      So, it will be seen, I was not getting on at all with my love-affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is pretty presumptuous in me to refer to it as a love-affair. That
      would intimate&mdash;calling it that&mdash;a bit of reciprocation on the
      part of Celene Kingsley. But she never showed any visible interest in me,
      even to looking my way when she met me on the street. I would have liked
      to attract her attention, for at last I wore shoes and had clothes without
      patches on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Skokums flourished under cover of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was Oramandel Bangs. He was rather simple, and always carried his
      mouth open, and nobody in Levant ever forgot that once a hornet flew in
      and stung his tongue and it swelled and stuck out of his mouth for days
      like the end of a bologna sausage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oramandel had a sneaking suspicion that witchcraft had never been wholly
      stamped out by his forefathers in New England.
    </p>
    <p>
      We decided to convince him that he was right&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing like
      clinching a man&rsquo;s faith in the good judgment of his ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hoisted one of his calves into an apple-tree. He &ldquo;unwitched&rdquo; the animal
      by cutting off its ears and tail before taking it down from the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      We tied cords to his ox-chains and hid ourselves and slashed the chains
      about the dooryard; he ran to the neighbors and reported that the witches
      had changed his chains into big snakes. We did a lot more things, and then
      imagination began to do the rest for him. He said the witches wouldn&rsquo;t
      allow him to do his farm-work, even though he had sumac-wood splinters in
      all his tools and stuck shears around his chum to make the butter come.
      Before we realized what mischief a lively imagination can do to a man,
      they were obliged to carry the old chap away to the asylum for the insane.
    </p>
    <p>
      And again Judge Kingsley held forth in the post-office. I guess he did a
      lot of talking at home, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, Celene Kingsley was mighty well posted, so I discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I met her on Purgatory Hill one day&mdash;and never did that name seem to
      apply so well! I had been out on my uncle&rsquo;s business, and among other
      plunder in the beach-wagon were two shotes in a crate, and they certainly
      were taking on about leaving home and mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was alone in her pony-chaise and the shaggy little brute she drove was
      frightened&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t blame him. I pulled as far into the gutter
      as I could and waited; I poked the butt of my whip into the crate and
      prodded those shotes, but that only made them screech the louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she came leading her pony past me. I didn&rsquo;t expect that she would stop
      and speak to me, but she did. I nearly fell off my seat. And she called me
      &ldquo;Mr. Sidney.&rdquo; It was the first time anybody had ever given me a handle to
      my name. I had pulled my hat off when I saw her coming; when she spoke to
      me I put it back on again and then took it off so that I could show her
      that I knew a little something about manners. However, I wasn&rsquo;t at all
      sure just what I was doing; my head was in a whirl, and I was damning
      those pigs in my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Mr. Sidney,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Pedro acts like a fool sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two hours afterward, I guess it was, I thought of just the right reply to
      that remark; as it was, I didn&rsquo;t say anything to her. I couldn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started on and then stopped and looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps she guessed something&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. Girls can act as if they
      never notice anything and still they have an eye out all the time; and
      what they don&rsquo;t see they know by instinct. At any rate, there was a lot of
      kindness in her face, and perhaps there was pity in her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I am very bold, Mr. Sidney. I hope you&rsquo;ll forgive me for
      speaking to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. Right there was another beautiful chance for me to say the
      good thing which came to me that night after I was in bed. All I could do
      at the time was duck my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to have any of the boys who went to school with me get into
      trouble on account of their thoughtlessness. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s only
      thoughtlessness and skylarking. But older folks, you know, don&rsquo;t
      understand and cannot sympathize with young folks. Now you won&rsquo;t tell
      anybody that I told you something, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just think of it! A secret between Celene Kingsley and myself!
    </p>
    <p>
      I gulped and shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell the boys&mdash;you&rsquo;ll know just how to pass the word&mdash;that
      folks are talking of having a detective to watch the village nights?&rdquo; She
      probably saw that I was incapable of uttering a sound and she went on,
      hurrying her words. &ldquo;Mr. Sidney, of course you understand that I am not
      picking you out as the ringleader. That&rsquo;s not why I am asking you to pass
      the word. But I know you are popular among the boys. They all speak so
      well of you! And I was so sorry when I heard that your dear mother had
      passed on. I wanted to write a bit of a note, but they are very strict at
      the boarding-school&mdash;we are not allowed to write to young gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Think of two shotes, squalling their heads off, furnishing accompaniment
      to that! But I&rsquo;ll say this of the shotes, they had spirit enough to use
      their voices&mdash;I was dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be terrible to have anybody arrested here in Levant for boyish
      pranks&mdash;it&rsquo;s all thoughtlessness, I&rsquo;m sure. You and I ought to be
      able to straighten everything out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough said!&rdquo; I shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flinched. Then I realized just how I must have sounded, for she said,
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to make you angry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I couldn&rsquo;t blame her for mistaking my looks; I was so mad at myself that I
      wanted to lash my back with my own whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no! It isn&rsquo;t the way you seem to think it is! I want to say that
      after this&mdash;after what you have said to me&mdash;if there&rsquo;s any more
      cutting-up in this village I&rsquo;ll-strip the pelt off the chap who does the
      job.&rdquo; I beat my hand on my breast. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the proudest day of my life when
      I can take orders from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t given orders, Mr. Sidney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have. They&rsquo;re orders to me. The littlest thing you can wish for is
      orders to me. If you said for me to cut my hand off I&rsquo;d do it. Oh, you
      don&rsquo;t know! I have&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how to say it&mdash;but for years&mdash;oh,
      I&rsquo;m crazy&mdash;&rdquo; And I was. It was lunacy provoked by the passion of love
      trying to outvoice those devilish shotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the funny look she gave me she was taking me at my word. She hurried to
      step into her little chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I mean is this,&rdquo; I quavered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make &rsquo;em quit. You look to
      me. I&rsquo;ll be responsible. Don&rsquo;t you worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure everything will be all right after this,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      depend on you, and I thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on her way, and the burden I had assumed seemed lighter than
      feathers and more precious than golden ingots.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had given me her confidence&mdash;she had asked me for a service!
    </p>
    <p>
      She had thought of me and my trouble when she was away at school!
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes before I had not dreamed that she was conscious that such a
      person as Ross Sidney walked the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, at all events, my poor self was in a little corner of her thoughts.
      She was looking to me for help in something which she had made her own
      concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rode down Purgatory Hill, hugging my joy and cursing those shotes.

    <h2>
      III&mdash;ON ACCOUNT OF A GIRL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> TRUST you have
      noted, by this time, that my yarn is not a mere chronicle of disconnected
      incidents. Linked circumstances seemed to be tying me up. One happening
      had pushed me on to another and I had allowed myself to be pushed. It
      might be urged, of course, that I had no business in inciting a mob to
      play hob with Mr. Bird&mdash;but I had my own interests to consider, and I
      had been listening to my uncle&rsquo;s teachings on the subject of looking out
      for number one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what happened to your father when he went to running his legs
      off on somebody else&rsquo;s business,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for me
      helping him in his other scrapes, your mother would have been playing
      hungryman&rsquo;s ratty-too on the bottom of the flour-barrel oftener than she
      did. I hope you&rsquo;ve got an ambition to be somebody and to have something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did have, but you may be sure I did not tell my uncle that my principal
      hankering to get money was so that I might lay it at the feet of Zebulon
      Kingsley&rsquo;s daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, by the expressed wish of that daughter, I started out to control
      happenings and to set myself in new ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed the word to the Skokums, keeping my promise to Celene.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to be indefinite, for I was guarding that little secret
      between her and myself as my most precious treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I remember it, I put it to the gang this way: &ldquo;We ought to behave
      ourselves and protect the good name of the town.&rdquo; They laughed at me and
      asked me if I had joined Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s Sunday-school class.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew they didn&rsquo;t suspect the truth, nevertheless that dig nearly put me
      out of countenance on account of the secret I was cherishing. I blushed
      and stammered and I lost my grip then and there as a leader&mdash;and it
      was the same old story&mdash;it was on account of a girl. A girl does
      rattle the gear of man-business!
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the fellows remarked that I was getting almighty pious after I had
      used them to clean up my own dirty job. He said the most of them had
      matters of their own which needed attention, and wanted to know if I
      proposed to sneak out on them after all the help they had given me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told them that I had thought the thing over carefully and had decided
      that what we had done to Mr. Bird was not right or lawful and we&rsquo;d better
      make no more mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then perhaps you want us to correct that mistake and make up a bee and
      carry the furniture back to the old cuss,&rdquo; suggested one of the Sortwell
      boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I failed to welcome that notion they turned on me in good earnest,
      and in my own heart I had to admit, looking on the surface of the thing,
      that they had good reason for thinking that I was both selfish and
      ungrateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Sixth Reader, at school, I had found the story of Frankenstein&rsquo;s
      monster. I saw that in organizing the Skokums I had built a lively little
      monster of my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a special and a private reason for asking you to quit and be good,
      boys,&rdquo; I told them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A member who keeps his private and special reasons to himself and doesn&rsquo;t
      trust the rest of us isn&rsquo;t much of a help in time of trouble,&rdquo; said Ben
      Pratt. &ldquo;I have never taken a whole lot of stock in you, Ross Sidney, and
      now I take less than ever before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From remarks which were dropped I gathered that the rest of them held
      similar sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to have a detective in here,&rdquo; I told them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But that was Celene Kingsley&rsquo;s secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had hoped that the threat might scare them. It had just the opposite
      effect; the boys of Levant had never seen a detective, but they had read
      every five-cent thriller on the subject. To be the object of a real
      detective&rsquo;s attention seemed like glorious adventure&mdash;and they were
      sure that they were, when on their own prowling-grounds, match for any
      sleuth who ever dodged behind trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I had stood up before her and had beaten fist upon my breast and had
      assured her that she could trust all to me. What sort of a knight was I to
      wear lady&rsquo;s favor and then fail to do and dare in her behalf?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had hoped that you knew me better and that I stood higher with you
      fellows,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit that you did a big job for me, and I am
      grateful. But you all had your fun out of it, for you have said so, over
      and over. You&rsquo;ll have to admit something, yourselves; you&rsquo;ll have to own
      up that we are ashamed of what we did to poor old Bangs. If you keep on
      you&rsquo;ll do other things to be ashamed of. I&rsquo;m advising you to stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want your advice,&rdquo; said Ben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll get something from me which you&rsquo;ll like a blamed sight less
      than advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plainly they were hungry for information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll that be?&rdquo; asked one of the Sortwell boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try on any more of your doodle-busting in this town and you&rsquo;ll find out,&rdquo;
       I said. Then I left them and went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some bright chap has made a simile about having as much privacy as a
      goldfish. At any rate, by leading an open life, one may be in a position
      to prove an alibi.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took to spending my evenings in the bar-room of the Levant Tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was by no means such a roystering sort of a life as it sounds to be.
      They used to sell liquor in the tavern in the old stage-coaching days,
      when the place was a post station; the little catty-cornered bar is there
      in the big room, its worn wood shiny from the dragging of rough fists and
      from many scrubbings; behind is the cupboard, with wavy glass set in
      diamond-shaped panes. But the cupboard was bare in my boyhood days and the
      shelves were dusty. Dodovah Vose, the landlord, was a teetotaler and
      believed in impressing that principle on others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen what liquor will do and undo,&rdquo; he said when he used to get on
      to the subject. &ldquo;In my young days, when the West Injy trade flourished and
      rum held its place without blushing, I have set in meeting and seen the
      parson soop a sip of rum-and-water between the firstly and secondly, and
      so on. It may have improved him and the sermon&mdash;I&rsquo;m not arguing. But
      do you think that liquor would ever have improved my brother Jodrey and
      made him the best deep-sea diver on the Atlantic coast, as he is to-day?
      No, gents! Where a man needs the strength of his arms, the full power of
      his ten fingers, the quickness of his brain, and the help of his lungs and
      a good heart&mdash;then he&rsquo;d better let liquor alone. That&rsquo;s what my
      brother says and he has been deeper underwater than any other man&mdash;and
      you can look around you and see some of the queer and wonderful things he
      has brought up for the peerusal of mankind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old foreroom was really a storehouse of curious pickings and gleanings
      which had been sent up-country, from time to time, by the diver brother.
      It had been one of my earliest haunts, for I had always hit it off nicely
      with Dodovah Vose. I did not lark about the room or molest the curios, as
      other boys in the village sometimes did.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, I always surveyed them with respect and interest; the awe
      I felt when I first laid eyes on them never left me, entirely. I have not
      been able to determine, exactly, whether my boyhood study of those objects
      inspired the hankering I developed, the burning desire to go down into the
      depths of the sea some day, or whether the queer things merely catered to
      my natural instinct in the matter. At any rate, I touched them reverently
      and I asked many questions of Landlord Vose and he told me hair-raising
      stories which, he said, his brother had told him. I remember that when I
      was so young I was still wearing a plaid kilt, I got down on all-fours and
      stuck my leg in the air at his request; he called it &ldquo;playing circus,&rdquo; and
      gave me a penny. He said I was a smart boy and allowed that a smart boy
      might grow up and be made a diver by Jodrey Vose. So there was an idea put
      into my head at an early age. And Dodovah Vose used to call me &ldquo;Lobster
      Sidney&rdquo;&mdash;a truly deep-water nickname! He had a rather droll idea of a
      joke&mdash;it was to prompt youngsters to go and make fools of themselves.
      My folks gave me the middle name of Webster. In order to plague the new
      schoolma&rsquo;am, Dodovah Vose told me to insist on the first day of school
      that my name was Ross Webster Lobster Sidney&mdash;and I did, even though
      the boys in the school laughed themselves sick. Mr. Vose praised me
      because I had obeyed orders, and gave me a conch-shell on which, by the
      aid of three finger-stops, one could play more or less of a tune. He had
      already given to me a shell which whispered in my ear the everlasting
      murmuring of the great ocean I had never seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a big fountain-shell from somewhere in the West Indies, and it
      fairly boomed, deep in its spirals, when I held it to my ear; I sensed all
      the vastness and the mystery and the solemnity of the ocean depths. The
      more I listened the better acquainted I seemed to be with a wonderful
      stranger far away at the other end of a wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It really seemed like a call to bigger things, and my job with my uncle
      was getting less and less to my taste. If there&rsquo;s any such thing as the
      angels looking down on earth over the parapets of heaven in their hours
      off duty, some of the things my uncle would do in horse trades, in order
      to get back at other cheaters, must have grieved the judicious in the
      upper spheres.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t realize it at the time, but I can look back now and see how my
      lashings to the life in Levant were in the way of severance, one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found no comfort in the lull of Skokum activities; I reckoned that the
      boys were reorganizing and getting ready for a really big slam. I felt as
      a timid girl must, feel in a thunder-shower when the thing is right
      overhead and there&rsquo;s an extra wait between claps.
    </p>
    <p>
      I continued to visit the tavern evenings and I came, into closer intimacy
      with Dodovah Vose. He brought, out old letters written by his brother and
      read them to me. In one Jodrey Vose described his venture on the sunken
      British frigate <i>Triton</i> somewhere off the coast, of Nova Scotia. She
      was bringing pay to the Hessian troops in the American colonies, so old
      reports had it. Jodrey Vose was more of a diver than a writer and his,
      letter had no frills. He informed his brother, who had invested modestly
      in the gamble at Jodrey&rsquo;s suggestion, that the thing was a failure, though
      the frigate had been located by dragging and Jodrey himself had gone down
      and explored her where she had lain for more than a century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diver Vose stated bluntly that he believed, from what; he saw down there,
      that the <i>Triton</i> had been scuttled or blown up by certain of her
      officers, who secured her treasure, escaped to the main in small boats and
      reported her loss in a storm; tradition has it that there was always
      considerable doubt about that storm. Also, tradition has it that those
      officers settled in America and lived happily ever after. Diver Vose tried
      to help pay expenses by raising the cannon. But though they seemed sound
      enough under the sea, they crumbled into lumpy masses after they were
      exposed to the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I never begrudged the money I put in,&rdquo; Dodovah Vose told me. &ldquo;I got
      my curiosity scratched where it had been itching for a good many years,
      ever since Jodrey and I first began to talk about the <i>Triton</i>. And I
      helped my brother get something off his mind. He wouldn&rsquo;t have died easy
      if he hadn&rsquo;t made sure about that treasure. I stand ready to invest in
      another scheme of his if he ever gets ready to tackle it. That&rsquo;s to go
      down and dig in the bottom of the river Tiber, providing he can fix it
      with the town officers of Rome. As near as we can find out from history,
      Jodrey and I, when the Romans wasn&rsquo;t throwing their treasures into the
      river to keep &rsquo;em away from one another in their civil wars, the
      barbarians were up to the same game, because they didn&rsquo;t enjoy art. And,
      of course, there&rsquo;s always the treasure of the <i>Golden Gate!</i> That&rsquo;s
      in modern times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was not in times sufficiently modern so that I knew anything about
      it, as my blank stare showed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She caught fire on her way from San Francisco to the Isthmus and was run
      ashore with three or four million dollars&rsquo; worth of gold ingots in her.
      That&rsquo;s fact! But Jodrey says there&rsquo;s been so much blasted lying done since
      by owners, underwriters, divers, claimers, and others, that nobody knows
      for sure just what has become of the treasure. That&rsquo;s another of his
      hankerings&mdash;to find out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More and more did I feel the spirit of adventure stirring in me!
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not understand why the whereabouts of that great treasure should
      remain in doubt, and so I expressed myself to Mr. Vose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some sort of a mystery about it&mdash;and so far&rsquo;s my brother is
      concerned he can&rsquo;t drop regular contracts to go chasing dreams&mdash;only
      once in so often. That <i>Triton</i> case made a hearty meal for his
      curiosity&mdash;he hasn&rsquo;t been hungry for high-spiced stuff since.&rdquo; He
      looked at me with shrewd kindness. &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll let you go on that job
      after he has made a diver out of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt a flush in my cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you have been poking a little fun at me all along when you have
      hinted at my being a diver, sir. Do you really believe your brother would
      give me a thought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might, if you went to him backed up with a letter from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a mind to ask you for that letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll not get it, my boy! I don&rsquo;t propose to have your uncle Deck
      come yowling and clawing at me like an old tom-cat because I have coaxed
      his handy-Andy away from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the kind of work he puts me to, Mr. Vose. I have grown up to
      be a man, almost, and I understand better than I did at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand, for instance, that when you took that cow away from
      Andrew P. Corson last week you left his baby without milk!&rdquo; He stroked his
      nose and peered at me from under eyelids that were cocked like little
      tents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a bill of sale! He made me go and get the cow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you know what your uncle did, after that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went to Andrew P. Corson and said you acted without orders. He lent
      Corson the money to buy another cow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stammered out something about not understanding that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do,&rdquo; said Landlord Vose. &ldquo;Your uncle Deck wants to get into
      politics in this town&mdash;he wants to get into politics far enough so
      that he can do something to Judge Kingsley. He reckons you don&rsquo;t need any
      popularity. He is starting you out with considerable of a handicap if you
      mean to live and prosper in your own town. However, I won&rsquo;t do anything to
      encourage you to leave! I&rsquo;ve got to keep on living in the town&mdash;alongside
      your uncle Deck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flash of family loyalty prompted me to assert that my uncle was good to
      the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he is,&rdquo; said Dodovah Vose. &ldquo;He is a queer man, your uncle is. But I
      don&rsquo;t want to make a pauper of myself in order to curry favor with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It came to me that I&rsquo;d better have a talk with my uncle, and I started
      out, crossing the village square on my way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once something landed heavily and violently on my shoulders, and
      the attack was so sudden that I was borne to the ground with such a crack
      of my forehead on the hard earth that I became unconscious, but not until
      I had felt claws of some sort tearing at my cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came to my senses I was back in the tavern foreroom and Dodovah
      Vose was swabbing my face with a sponge wet in warm water. In a corner of
      the room Constable Nute and two helpers were hog-tying old Bennie Holt,
      the village fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a dove of peace no longer&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t a rooster no longer,&rdquo; he
      was squalling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bald-headed eagle! They told me I&rsquo;m an eagle. I
      allus knowed I was some kind of a fowl. They lied to me when they said I
      was a dove of peace. I&rsquo;m an eagle. See what I&rsquo;ve done! I&rsquo;ve mallywhacked
      him. He made fun of me when I was a dove. Others made fun of me&mdash;but
      now they&rsquo;d better look out. I&rsquo;m an eagle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the old idiot had been or thought he had been, he was then
      plainly a raving maniac. In his struggles he was shedding turkey feathers
      with which he had thatched his coat. As far back as I could remember old
      Bennie Holt, he used to stand in the square with feathers of various sorts
      stuck around his hat, harmlessly indulging his vagary. But never before
      had he raised his hand against any human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon that this time you fired a boomerang, young Sidney,&rdquo; stated the
      constable, reproachfully. &ldquo;Old Bangs didn&rsquo;t fly back and hit you, but this
      one has. The village will be glad to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better be careful what you report about me,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him. &ldquo;I had nothing whatever to do with old Bennie. Mr. Vose will
      answer for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know where to plaster the blame when anything happens in this place,&rdquo;
       insisted Nute. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve sent another one to the bug-house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It did not seem to be of much use to talk to that raving old man, but I
      tried it. I asked him who had been talking to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My guardeen angels,&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;They all come to me and told me. They
      was in white and they told me.&rdquo; I myself had furnished the pillow-case
      cowls to the Skokums out of the second-hand stock in my uncle&rsquo;s
      storehouse!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be some mistake this time, Nute,&rdquo; said Landlord Vose. &ldquo;Young
      Sidney has been spending his evenings here in the tavern for quite some
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trying to put up a bluff, that&rsquo;s all. The one who-torches on a fool can&rsquo;t
      complain if the fool kicks back. Here&rsquo;s more expense to the town, boarding
      an insane man at the State hospital. It didn&rsquo;t cost us anything as long as
      he e&rsquo;t broken crackers out of the grocery-stores, and slept in the
      livery-stable. I reckon Town-Treasurer Kingsley will say that this ends up
      his patience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to tell Judge Kingsley that I had anything to do with
      getting old Bennie in this state,&rdquo; I cried. My face smarted dreadfully,
      for Dodovah Vose-. was putting on some kind of stuff to kill the poison of
      the-, tool&rsquo;s finger-nails, so he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to tell him; he&rsquo;ll know it for himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out who did do it! I know well enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was maddening&mdash;this determination on the part of Levant to put me
      in the wrong in all matters of local disturbance. Here was I, victim of
      the resentment of the Skokums because I was trying to obey my promise to
      Celene Kingsley, now in imminent danger of further repute as the
      ringleader of the latest atrocity&mdash;even though I was the sole
      sufferer after the devil had been stirred up in the old loafer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fired him, and the boomerang swung around back and hit you&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all,&rdquo; insisted the constable. &ldquo;His mouth has been full of something you
      have done to him. If it wasn&rsquo;t you he wouldn&rsquo;t be talking about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Dodovah Vose was finishing with my lacerated face I pondered on what
      he had said about my uncle&rsquo;s indifference in regard to my popularity in
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I stood up in the tavern foreroom and cursed family and foes and town
      with such lurid invective&mdash;my vocabulary and force being so far
      beyond the ordinary capabilities of youth&mdash;that even the crazy man
      was shocked into silence. I was ashamed of myself even as I ranted. But
      then, as in after-times, my temper swept me out of myself. I was blind and
      dizzy and there was a roar in my ears like the rush of water. I swung the
      fires of anger about myself as a juggler whirls his flaming torches. I was
      sorry as soon as it was over&mdash;I have always been sorry when my frenzy
      has passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I bowed my head and walked out of the tavern I heard the constable
      clucking away like an offended old hen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a matter for the judge to consider&mdash;language and all,&rdquo; he
      declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I insist that he is a good boy in his heart,&rdquo; said Dodovah Vose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be&mdash;coming out of that family&mdash;and with the general
      reputation he has got since he has worked for his uncle the last four
      years,&rdquo; insisted the constable. Fine dwelling-place for me&mdash;Levant,
      eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle was in bed and asleep when I got to the house&mdash;and perhaps
      it was just as well, because I was quickly forgetting my shame and was
      ready for a further squabble; a disposition on my part which has never
      been especially helpful during my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made careful and disgusted study of my striped face in the looking-glass
      before I went to bed. In spite of my innocence, there I was, the labeled
      participator in an affray. In this world, as you have probably noticed,
      the man who carries around a blacked eye or a bunged lip never succeeds in
      dissipating the suspicion that he has been in some sort of a disgraceful
      mix-up, in which he was more or less to blame. You may remember how you
      yourself have felt in the case of your friends, even when a sliding rug or
      a closet door has been saddled with the blame. A man with a marked-up
      physog is never at his best as a defendant. I dreaded the next day, for it
      seemed pretty certain that I would have to face Judge Kingsley. But the
      feeling that his daughter might be brought to doubt the sincerity of my
      promises, when she heard the story and beheld my face, kept me awake more
      effectually than did the pain of that ferocious clapperclawing.

    <h2>
      IV&mdash;THE TRAINING OF THE QUEEN OF &ldquo;SHEBY&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> WAS awake so long
      in the night I overslept next morning, of course. Breakfast had been
      cleared away by the time I got dressed and was down-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had made up my mind to have a run-in with my uncle, but I was starting
      with a disadvantage. Coming late to breakfast in that busy household
      amounted almost to a crime, and the look of disgust my aunt Lucretia set
      on my face made my courage drop tail. She was never amiable, and she
      considered me an intruder in the family, as well I knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have left your doughnuts and coffee in the but&rsquo;ry&mdash;and your uncle
      wants you in the stable.&rdquo; She turned her back and went on with what she
      was doing at the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ate the doughnuts on my way to the stable, trying to whip up my rancor.
      I expected to be received with a hoot and a howl, and depended on those
      spurs to start my own temper on the gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Deck was just pushing a bottle back into the oats in the bin. He
      slammed down the cover and wiped his mouth and grinned at me. He was in
      the best of good humor. I was chewing on food his money had bought, and, I
      repeat, he was as pleasant as a basket of chips. In the face of that I
      couldn&rsquo;t screw a mean word out of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sure was some operator with her claws,&rdquo; he remarked. But he wouldn&rsquo;t
      listen to my indignant explanation; he plainly had his own business on his
      mind that morning, and it was business which seemed to be affording much
      satisfaction. He gave me a push toward the harness-room, the sanctum where
      he performed most of his deviltry in horse matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that harness-room was hitched the worst-looking old pelter of a plug I
      had ever laid eyes on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Deck put his hands on his hips and swapped looks between myself and
      the horse. He was master of a certain kind of cheap, horse-jockey patter
      which he employed at fairs when he wanted to call a crowd around. He
      struck a pose and &ldquo;orated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having a knowledge of hoss pedigree, relatives, previous condition of
      servitude, religious preferences, and other matters pertaining to, and so
      forth, even going back to the fact that the hoss Bucephalorus, that was
      owned by the late Aleck the Great, cocked his left hind leg when he stood
      in the stall, had a nicked right ear, and a wind-gall puff behind each
      fore shoulder, I want to say that I reckon that never before was there
      gathered, collected, and assembled on four legs every kind of a pimple,
      bump, wheeze, scratch, spavin, horn ail, hock bunch, trick, and
      bobblewhoop, that&rsquo;s laid down by old Medicombobulus, in his book entitled
      &lsquo;Things a Hoss Can Get Along Without.&rsquo; I call this ancient Gothic ruin
      &lsquo;Carpenter Boy,&rsquo; sired by Pod Auger, dammed by Hemlock Maid&mdash;and, in
      fact, damned by everybody who has ever owned him. Speed is developed in
      him by feeding the celebrated spiral oats, produced by crossing shoe-pegs
      with bed-springs, which in process of being digested uncoil and carry the
      animile in leaps like the mountain-goat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that outburst I definitely, in my own mind, set forward to some
      future date the matter of an understanding with my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it ever happen that anybody could unload this on you?&rdquo; I asked
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I went out hunting for it, sonny. It was the worst I could do on
      short notice. If it had looked worse and had had more ailments and outs I
      would have paid more for it. Now ask no more questions, but lend a hand to
      what I tell you to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have no time to go into the details of what my uncle Deck did to that
      equine framework, but if I could describe it all I&rsquo;d be furnishing
      considerable of a handbook for the uses of tricky horse-swappers. I had
      helped in many similar jobs in that back room of his stable, but I had
      never seen him put so much art and soul into the work before; he seemed to
      have special reasons for his painstaking toil. He chuckled whenever he
      secured a particularly good result; at times he gritted his teeth and
      swore under his breath regarding some party whom he did not name. But I
      gathered that this transformation of a horse was intended as satisfaction
      of one of his bitterest grudges.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had everything to do with in that horse beauty-parlor of his. There
      were ointments and colorings, false hair for mane and tail, skin-patches
      and disguises for puffs and swellings. But still the horse remained gaunt;
      the rafters of his ribs suggested that he needed to be shingled in. To my
      general wonderment as to what my uncle was about, anyway, was now added
      more lively curiosity; how was this living skeleton to be disguised as to
      skinniness? I found out before long. My uncle put on the poor brute a
      bridle with a wicked twist-bit and told me to hold him, no matter how much
      he kicked about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Uncle Deck brought out a bit of board into which shoe-pegs had been
      set thickly. He began to clap the pegged board against the horse&rsquo;s skin. I
      had my work cut out for me after that, I can tell you. The pain must have
      been excruciating, for the bradding-pegs raised blisters. In a little
      while the ribs were hidden by this new and deceptive plumpness. The horse
      took on the appearance of an animal which had been well cared for in the
      food line. And he certainly displayed the spirit of Phoebus&rsquo;s nigh
      wheel-horse. His nostrils snorted furiously and his eyes flamed. It seemed
      incredible that this animal with flowing mane and tail, with round barrel
      and smooth limbs, was the decrepit old creature I had seen on my arrival
      in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, my uncle Deck oiled the horse from stem to stem, smoothing the
      hair into place, and then stood and admired his handiwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s see what the needle will do for style and knee action,&rdquo; he
      said. He gave the horse a jab with the hypodermic&mdash;I had seen him do
      that at horse-trots just before the race was started. He hitched a long
      rope into the bridle and led the animal out into the yard. In a few
      moments the horse was prancing and curveting and whickering like a
      blueblood of youth and spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he won&rsquo;t last this way!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle turned withering side-glance on me. &ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;re telling
      me something I didn&rsquo;t know? Of course he won&rsquo;t last. I don&rsquo;t want him to
      last. If he would pop like a blown-up paper bag when I got ready to have
      it happen I&rsquo;d like it all the better. But, as it is, it&rsquo;ll be bad enough.
      Don&rsquo;t you know a good name for him out of some of those books you have
      read, son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But while I was hesitating my uncle dipped in with his usual impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of it already! &lsquo;Judge,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s his name. When she hears
      Trufant call him &lsquo;Judge&rsquo; the coincidence will catch her interest, likely
      enough. She will prick up her ears!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Right then I pricked up my own ears. I understood mighty sudden. I had
      seen the writing tacked on the notice-board in the post-office the day
      before. Judge Kingsley had let it be known that he was in the market for a
      driving-horse, suitable for use by ladies. I had read it with mingled
      emotions, realizing that Celene Kingsley had grown to girlhood out of
      childhood; no longer a pony-cart for her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll never buy a horse from you?&rdquo; I blurted, staring at my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who won&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Kingsley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably he wouldn&rsquo;t if he thought it came from <i>me</i>. But I&rsquo;m
      baiting a hook that he&rsquo;ll swallow or I&rsquo;m no guesser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My eyes were full of questions and he saw fit to humor me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing it&rsquo;s all in the family, son, I&rsquo;ll tell you. I&rsquo;ve got to let out a
      few holes in my surcingle or I&rsquo;ll bust. &lsquo;Squealing John&rsquo; Runnels, of
      Carmel, will drive this hoss into Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s dooryard to-night,
      around dusk, representing that he is a poor woman who needs money in a
      hurry so that she can get her husband out of trouble. &lsquo;Squealing John&rsquo; has
      got a woman&rsquo;s voice, and he will wear some of his wife&rsquo;s clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you can get a man to do that,&rdquo; I objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle raised his hand above his head and slowly clinched his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man will do &lsquo;most anything when you&rsquo;ve got a foreclosure clutch on his
      weazen. I&rsquo;m making the whole thing plenty crazy so that the laugh will be
      bigger when the truth comes out. He&rsquo;ll buy this hoss&mdash;there&rsquo;s no
      doubt of it. Old John will give him only twenty minutes to decide. Short
      notice on account of the hypo juice I&rsquo;ll shoot in up around the turn of
      the street! Must have a quick decision because I reckon the hoss will
      stagger up against a fence and die mighty soon after old John gets out of
      sight. Clek-clek! Gid-dap!&rdquo; He yanked on the rope and the horse frolicked.
      &ldquo;Whoa, Judge! Plenty of knee action! Sound in wind, limb, and peepers!
      Safe for the ladies!&rdquo; He pulled in on the rope, grabbed the bridle, and
      led the horse to a stall. &ldquo;If we get over two hundred I&rsquo;ll slip you ten
      dollars for your part of the job,&rdquo; he called to me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for you to
      understand that there&rsquo;s good money in a sharp dicker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not have the courage to tell him what I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to frame some sort of a reproach when he went to the oat-bin and
      pulled out his bottle. But he grinned over his shoulder at me! If he had
      had any short and sharp words for me that day I would have burst out, I&rsquo;m
      sure of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was wonderfully kind to me that last day I ever spent in his home,
      under his thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better stay close around the house till your face looks less like
      the battle-flag of freedom, son,&rdquo; he advised me. &ldquo;Cats will be cats, and
      girls will show claws!&rdquo; He went away about his business and I hung around
      the stable, taking a look every now and then at the preposterous horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was made party to a most horrible deceit on Celene Kingsley. To be sure,
      the fraud most nearly concerned her father and his money. But the horse
      was destined for her. I could not get that idea out of my thoughts.
      Probably, after the trade had been made, my uncle would brag that I had
      helped him. How would she view me? It must seem to her that some of my
      promises had already been broken, for I was certain that the matter of old
      Bennie was being canvassed that day in the village. There was such a thing
      as family loyalty, I admitted, as I pondered on the situation. But to
      allow my tough uncle to tramp through the little sanctuary where I
      enshrined my love, to pull me into a vulgar scheme which must ruin forever
      all my hopes, poor and futile though they were, these were sacrifices I
      did not feel called on to undergo. I had my own pride to consider. I no
      longer dreamed of ever possessing Celene Kingsley. What was in me was a
      romantic hope that she would think on me once in a while when I was far,
      far away&mdash;remembering that I was her slave in what she asked and that
      I had asked nothing of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, to have her memories of me mixed in with thoughts of the
      horse-trading cheat which I had connived at was reflection unendurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to the wood-shed and secured an ax. It occurred to me that when a
      horse had so many bumps on him, one more and a deadly bump on his forehead
      would not attract much attention; furthermore, my uncle seemed to think
      that the animal&rsquo;s course was nearly run.
    </p>
    <p>
      I faced the brute. His ears were hanging in despondency. His eyes were
      dropping tears; those blisters must have been stinging like the martyr&rsquo;s
      skin under the shirt of fire. When I looked on that woe all my resolution
      left me. I dropped the ax. There were tears in my own eyes. I felt as if
      he were my brother in common sorrow. So I went to the cellar and fetched
      apples and carrots and fed them into his gratefully slobbering mouth until
      he sighed and spraddled his legs and went to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constable Nute came for me during the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t any subpeny to this, young Sidney,&rdquo; he informed me. &ldquo;If you
      feel too guilty to face Judge Kingsley, who is making an informal
      investigation, you needn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not guilty. I&rsquo;m not afraid to face the judge.&rdquo; And I went along.
      There was no one else in his office. He had been calling in persons and
      examining them one by one. I was alone with him after Nute left.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave in my version of what had happened the night before and declared
      that I had had nothing whatever to do with putting notions into the noddle
      of the village fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as to this society of young vandals which has been disgracing the
      village? Certain members of the gang have confessed to me that you are the
      organizer and the ringleader.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I confess that I <i>was</i> leader at first,&rdquo; I owned up to him, just
      as manfully as I could. Then I told him about Mr. Bird. &ldquo;When I realized
      that I was making a mistake I stopped being leader. I have had nothing to
      do with the society since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a way of shooting speech out through his pinched nostrils with a
      sort of a jew&rsquo;s-harp twang. He leaned back in his chair and gave me a good
      looking over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Becoming an angel overnight by the natural piety of the Sidney
      disposition, eh? Young man, you are lying to me! Now tell me the real
      reason why you quit your devilishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had no mind to tell him, and I was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had another reason, didn&rsquo;t you? A better reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I confessed that I had. But I wouldn&rsquo;t tell him what it was, even when he
      raised his voice to me and pounded on the table with his fist. If he had
      been the right kind of a man I would have told him, for a proper man would
      have been proud of his daughter under those circumstances. But I knew that
      Judge Kingsley would consider that she had disgraced herself by talking to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell the truth&mdash;you won&rsquo;t tell the truth&mdash;for the
      truth isn&rsquo;t in you,&rdquo; he stormed. &ldquo;You are convicted by the tongues of the
      boys who have owned up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew there were sneaks in the crowd&mdash;that&rsquo;s another reason I had
      for getting out, Judge Kingsley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anything else happens in this village we shall know where to place the
      blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair, Judge Kingsley!&rdquo; I remonstrated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not getting a square
      deal in this thing. I know that old Nute has been talking to you the way
      he calked to me last night. They are all bound to put the blame on to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir! You don&rsquo;t know for yourself. You say I can&rsquo;t tell the truth!
      I&rsquo;ll show you that I can, even when it&rsquo;s to my own hurt&mdash;yes, sir, to
      my awful hurt! You have advertised for a horse, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle is going to send around a man dressed in woman&rsquo;s clothes&mdash;this
      very evening&mdash;so as to fool you in the dusk with the worst fraud ever
      propped on four legs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That confession didn&rsquo;t help me a bit and I ought to have had sense enough
      to know it before I opened my mouth. I had made the judge more thoroughly
      angry than ever; I had offended his pride as a shrewd business man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What cock-and-bull yam is this? Do you think I can be fooled by cheap
      horse-jockey tricks? You young fool, what do you mean by insulting me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just wait till you see the horse,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;I helped fix him and
      I didn&rsquo;t know him, myself, after the job was done. But I don&rsquo;t want to see
      you gulled, Judge Kingsley. I am following new ways from now on. You know
      my uncle and how I am beholden to him! When I open up to you about him it
      ought to show you that I want to be honest, no matter how much the truth
      is going to harm me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no decency in this town&mdash;not even honor among thieves,&rdquo;
       snarled the judge. He pointed to the door. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all for now, young
      Sidney! Remember for yourself&mdash;and tell others&mdash;that the grand
      jury sits in this county within a fortnight! Upon actions from now on
      depends what the county prosecutor will be inclined to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s office was a sort of ell affair built out from the side
      of his mansion. When I left it I ducked around to the rear of the house
      and made off down through the orchard, having no relish to show my clawed
      face to the public. I had my day to myself and I did not hurry; I had many
      things to ponder on.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once I heard the sound of somebody running on the turf behind me. I
      turned and faced Celene. I curved my forearm across my countenance,
      ashamed of my appearance, her own flushed cheeks were so radiantly
      beautiful!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know how it happened. I&rsquo;m sure it wasn&rsquo;t your fault,&rdquo; she said,
      graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ste&rsquo;boyed him on to me!&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;I have tried to make &rsquo;em
      stop their tricks, just as I promised you. So they did this to put me in
      wrong. Your father is hard on me! I tried to make him understand that I&mdash;&mdash;well,
      I wanted&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I overheard&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t help overhearing.&rdquo; Then her cheeks grew
      rosier. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll own up. I listened at the door. I wanted to know. And that&rsquo;s
      why I came after you. You have kept our little secret and I know you have
      done your best in other ways. So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here. I want to thank you.
      And&mdash;I&mdash;Well, I think that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to finish it as far as I was concerned, too; I couldn&rsquo;t pump a
      word up out of myself. So we stood there and looked up into the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father has been talking to them to-day,&rdquo; she said, after a time. &ldquo;Perhaps
      they are warned now and won&rsquo;t be up to any more mischief. And they ought
      to be sorry for what they have done to you. I think you can have a lot of
      influence over them after this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. I&rsquo;m going away from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That statement astonished her just as much as it astonished me. I had not
      thought of announcing my departure ten seconds before; it had not been in
      my mind that I was going away. But all of a sudden the memory of what I
      had told the judge about the horse popped into my thoughts. Considering
      what would be my uncle&rsquo;s state of mind after the exposure, I reckon the
      going-away idea followed as naturally as the right answer in a sum of
      addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had supposed that your outlook&mdash;your position with your uncle&mdash;was
      very promising,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The town needs smart men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fact that she had spent one thought upon my condition interested me
      more than the implied compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I stay with him I&rsquo;ll only be a country cheat and horse-dickerer. I
      want to be something else,&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;This very day my uncle is trying
      to put up a job on your father. I have told the judge about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you. It was another reason why I wanted to speak to you&mdash;to
      encourage you in being honest. There&rsquo;s no need of father bringing you into
      the matter at all. It would only make trouble between your uncle and you.
      I&rsquo;ll speak to father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not, for then you&rsquo;d be making trouble for yourself. I&rsquo;d
      rather take all the blame of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stood and looked at each other for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a coward,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it will come out about me blabbing&mdash;some way it will come out.
      There&rsquo;s no need of you being in the scrape. I&rsquo;m going away, and I may as
      well go flying while I&rsquo;m about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope&mdash;&rdquo; she said, and that was as far as she got. I know how I was
      feeling inside and perhaps my feelings showed too plainly on that striped
      face of mine. She looked scared and turned and hurried away. I didn&rsquo;t know
      whether she hoped I&rsquo;d stay in Levant or hoped I&rsquo;d do well wherever I might
      roam. I watched her out of sight and she did not turn to look at me. I
      couldn&rsquo;t exactly figure that out&mdash;whether she didn&rsquo;t want to give me
      a last glance or didn&rsquo;t dare to.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fingered in my vest pocket while she was running away; when she
      disappeared I pulled out a packet and opened it. There were three rings in
      it. One was a coral ring; I bought it when I was fifteen and paid thirty
      cents for it. I never had the courage to give it to her when we were at
      school. There was a silver ring which I bought a year later when my
      circumstances were a little better&mdash;better than my courage. Lastly,
      there was a gold ring which I had secured in a dicker soon after our
      meeting on Purgatory Hill. I am not going to discourse on the fool impulse
      which prompted me to buy those rings and stick them in my vest pocket. Nor
      will I say anything concerning another impulse which made me wrap the
      rings up and drop them into a cleft in the trunk of an apple-tree. If I
      did not dare to give them to her, at least I could leave them on her
      premises. Then I went by back ways to my uncle&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I was out of sight of Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s mansion I looked behind me
      several times. I didn&rsquo;t know but I might see a flutter of a handkerchief
      from some window, for a vague and queer kind of hope was still in me. I
      saw no flutter, but I did see a strange man who was strolling along my
      trail. I was too busy with other thoughts to wonder who he might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found my uncle admiring the transmogrified horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been whetting the old hellion&rsquo;s appetite,&rdquo; he said, and I knew by
      the expression on his face that he was referring to Judge Kingsley. &ldquo;I
      have had half a dozen fellows from the back districts drive one old skate
      after another into his dooryard, and inside of an hour he&rsquo;ll have a chance
      to inspect a few more skeletons and bone-piles. By nightfall he&rsquo;ll be
      hungry for a peek at something which doesn&rsquo;t look as if it would have to
      be pushed on casters by iron reins. Oh, he&rsquo;s hungry! He&rsquo;ll swallow this
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More than ever was I coming to understand into what complicated and
      precious gears I had flung my trig&mdash;and what the consequences to me
      were likely to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now come out into the harness-room,&rdquo; commanded my uncle. &ldquo;I want you to
      have a look at the Queen of Sheby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had never seen &ldquo;Squealing John&rdquo; Runnels, but that this was he I had no
      doubt. He sat on an upturned grain-bucket with his skirts pulled up about
      him, wore a woman&rsquo;s broad hat of dingy black felt, and a veil partly
      draped his face; he was smoking a corn-cob pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be cussed if I see any good sense in being titrivated out like this
      the whole afternoon,&rdquo; he complained, in tones as strident as a scolding
      woman&rsquo;s. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting on to my nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to get used to &rsquo;em, you old fool,&rdquo; barked my uncle, &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t propose to have you forgetting yourself. It would be just like you,
      right in the middle of that dicker-talk, to prill up your dress and reach
      into your pants pocket for a plug of tobacco. Now get up and let me see
      you practise walking; and forget that you&rsquo;re wearing pants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Runnels went grunting and limping around the room, whining like a teased
      quill-pig. His feet were pinched into women&rsquo;s shoes. My uncle seemed to
      see much humor in this exhibition, but I couldn&rsquo;t find any. It looked to
      me only like a grotesque sham, and pitiful, too, for I knew it was not
      going to succeed. &ldquo;Squealing John&rdquo; appeared to be of the same opinion. He
      kept complaining that he would not be able to fool a sharp man like the
      judge, and asked, anxiously, what the law penalty was when a man dressed
      up like a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a good mind to let ye foreclose and be shet of the thing,&rdquo; he said,
      facing my uncle and cracking together his bony little fists. &ldquo;All that
      will come of this trick is that I&rsquo;ll be took up and sent to jail. I&rsquo;m a
      good mind to go to the judge and tell him how I&rsquo;m persecuted and hectored
      and see if he won&rsquo;t take up that bill o&rsquo; sale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you if you do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll kill anybody else who blows on me and
      my plans: Now, Queen of Sheby, remember that this is my champion
      performance. I ain&rsquo;t in any frame of mind to be trifled with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to the oat-bin and brought in his bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need to be teaed up a little so that you&rsquo;ll have some courage, you
      old angleworm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the two of them had swallowed stiff drinks my uncle turned on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have half a mind to dress you up instead of Runnels, son. Your face is
      smooth and you&rsquo;ve got nerve enough to act the thing out right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not turn any such trick,&rdquo; I said. I was angry in a moment. So was
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will if I tell you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t; and I&rsquo;ll say further that I don&rsquo;t think much of this business,
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I&mdash;and that&rsquo;s two against one,&rdquo; declared Runnels, the tip of his
      thin nose beginning to glow as if new courage had hung out a banner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Liquor had also given my uncle&rsquo;s temper an edge of its own; he cuffed
      Runnels until that lamenting &ldquo;lady&rsquo;s&rdquo; hat fell off. I jumped up and ran
      away into the fields, for I knew that Uncle Deck was merely warming up on
      &ldquo;Squealing John&rdquo;; as chief mutineer, I was ticketed for the real bout. I
      lurked about in the pine grove till after sunset. Then I stole back into
      the village with all the stealth of a criminal.

    <h2>
      V&mdash;SHOOING AWAY A SCAPEGOAT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> RECKON it&rsquo;s best
      for innocence to go boldly in this world. At any rate, I would have come
      off better that night if I had not lurked and prowled. However, I was only
      obeying very wise dictates of prudence; my uncle had been sufficiently
      savage in the harness-room when rebellion was merely in process of
      hatching. To meet him after Judge Kingsley had exploded the bomb&mdash;and
      I was sure that I would be revealed in the matter&mdash;would be like
      getting in the path of a Bengal tiger with snap-crackers blistering his
      tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wasn&rsquo;t at all certain what I would do after I found out that I had been
      exposed to my uncle&rsquo;s fury; first of all, so I felt, it was essential to
      learn what had developed in the horse trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I stole in the gloom around behind the buildings of the village and
      retraced my trail up through the judge&rsquo;s orchard. While I was still some
      distance from the mansion I heard considerable of a hullabaloo above which
      rose the shrill voice of &ldquo;Squealing John&rdquo; Runnels, who was issuing
      warnings about &ldquo;laying a whip on that hoss.&rdquo; Then there was a racketing
      and a splintering and down past me came an outfit which I recognized. The
      horse was certainly the brute my uncle had doctored into false
      shapeliness; the mane was dangling in shreds where the apple-tree limbs
      had raked. Runnels, his woman&rsquo;s hat hanging on his back, was kneeling on
      the bottom of the wagon, both hands full of false hair which he had reaped
      from the horse&rsquo;s tail in effort to check the animal; he had lost the reins
      and they were dragging uselessly on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far from me the wagon was flailed against a tree and Mr. Runnels was
      violently dislodged; but I judged that he was not injured because, after
      rolling over and over on the turf, he rose and ran away with his skirts
      gathered around his waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that my uncle&rsquo;s plot had failed ingloriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could understand the flash of fresh spirit in that moribund horse;
      Runnels had shrieked warnings regarding a whip; a lash laid across those
      tingling water-blisters must have made that poor old pelter develop a
      hankering to outfly Pegasus. He disappeared with fragments of the thills
      clattering on his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there were immediate and further developments in that orchard. I
      thought for a startled moment that it was enchanted ground. White figures
      began to pop up here and there and came flocking to me. I found myself
      surrounded by the Skokums, wearing the pillowcase masks I had furnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      They seemed to think I had some information regarding the runaway or was
      concerned in it, but I had no news to give out. One of them brought the
      old felt hat with its broken feather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there was any woman in these parts who could cuss like that
      one did when she went down through the orchard,&rdquo; said one of the Sortwell
      boys. &ldquo;I reckon that detective is finding mysteries piling in on him
      pretty thick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What detective?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one that Judge Kingsley has been hiding in his house. That detective
      was hid in a closet in the office to-day when the judge was asking
      questions of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know he was there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cigar smoke was coming out of the cracks in the closet door. So somebody
      was hid. And since then he has been outdoors and we piped him off. He
      followed you home. Didn&rsquo;t you see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did remember the strange man who had been loafing along behind me, but I
      kept my own counsel. I had a more important matter on my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know which of you fellows told Judge Kingsley to-day that I am
      ringleader of this gang?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one answered me. They went on making fun of the detective, and I&rsquo;ll
      admit that it seemed to me that he was putting up a poor job in his line.
      My reading had given me a rather exalted idea of detectives, but a man who
      smoked behind a closet door while eavesdropping, and through whose
      identity those country boys saw straightway, was certainly a clumsy
      operator. Therefore, I lost interest in him and persisted in my own
      business with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to overlook your dirty work in setting old Bennie on to me,&rdquo; I
      said. &ldquo;You may have done it only for a joke, and there&rsquo;s no telling what a
      fool will do when you start him off. But there&rsquo;s no joke in blowing on me
      to Judge Kingsley&mdash;and you say there was a detective listening behind
      a door. Now own up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nobody volunteered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him myself that I was in it at first. But when I said I was out of
      it he made it plain that some of you are still putting the blame on me.
      Whoever has said anything of that kind to him is a sneak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No word from any of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the fellow who won&rsquo;t speak up to me now, so that we can settle this
      thing, is a coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no such thing as picking out a guilty face in that crowd; they
      were hooded with those pillow-slips. I wasn&rsquo;t sure which was which; I
      couldn&rsquo;t locate even Ben Pratt in the gang, and he was the special chap I
      had in mind as informer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can say this,&rdquo; stated one of the boys, &ldquo;that I didn&rsquo;t mention your name
      to the judge, Ross. So there&rsquo;s no chance for a fight between you and me.
      But when you come to twitting about the throwing-down business, let me
      remind you that you did the first job in that line; you threw us all down.
      And that was after we had turned a trick that saved you and your uncle
      good money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what the rest of you wanted to do was go around in the night and
      raise the devil in this town, simply for the sake of mischief. I wouldn&rsquo;t
      do that, and I told you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how about a case where we&rsquo;d be protecting ourselves against somebody
      who was doing us dirt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing like that has been put up to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be in about three seconds. You organized this society; now
      do something for it. We&rsquo;re going to coat that detective with molasses and
      feathers and ride him out of the village on a rail. We call on you to boss
      the job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then join in with us and help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t mischief&mdash;it&rsquo;s tackling an enemy. You haven&rsquo;t got any
      good excuse for throwing us down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an excuse that suits <i>me</i>. I have made up my mind to travel
      straight in this town, after this. I&rsquo;m going to do it. I have my own good
      reasons for doing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost your courage, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It takes more courage to stand up here and say what I&rsquo;m saying than to
      lead this mob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So <i>you</i> say, but that doesn&rsquo;t convince <i>us</i>. Go home, then,
      and get out from underfoot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It came to me all of a sudden and with sickening force that it required
      more courage to go home and face my uncle than to undertake any other
      project which my mind could grasp just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood stock-still and they began to suspect my motives in sticking
      around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t head the party, you won&rsquo;t go along as a member, you won&rsquo;t get
      out of the way,&rdquo; growled a voice, and I recognized Ben Pratt. &ldquo;What do you
      intend to do&mdash;make a holler?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could be just as stiff in temper as any of that Levant bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good deal depends on what you devils intend to do,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may as well know at the start-off! We intend to have that detective
      out of Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s house! If he doesn&rsquo;t come out when we call him we
      shall go in and get him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a prison crime&mdash;entering a house like that,&rdquo; I warned them.
      &ldquo;Also, think what a report that is to go out from Levant! A guest of our
      leading citizen dragged from a private residence by a mob! There&rsquo;s a
      sacredness about a home&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What book did you get that out of?&rdquo; asked some one, and they laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose it did sound mighty top-lofty and unlike anything else that ever
      came from me. But I was thinking with all my might of Celene Kingsley and
      what an awful thing it would be to have those young hyenas invade that
      house in the night-time. You can say what you want to about hoodlumism in
      the city&mdash;it&rsquo;s bad! But you&rsquo;ve got to go back into the country for
      unadulterated hellishness, when a mob really gets started. Furthermore,
      nobody is especially afraid of a village constable. I could foresee dirty
      doings that night in Levant. I had seen one mob in Levant when I was a
      youngster; they tarred and feathered a fanatical evangelist, and he died
      of fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to think up something in the way of argument and I stammered about
      local pride and so forth, but my talk didn&rsquo;t ring true, and I felt it and
      they knew it. Personally, I didn&rsquo;t care a hoot about that clumsy fool of a
      detective, and I was not remarkably fond of sneering Judge Kingsley. If I
      could have stepped up to those boys and explained my love and my hopes and
      my fears for Celene Kingsley I might have made some impression on them.
      But that was not to be thought of.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I talked I saw them crawling toward me, spreading out, two by two.
      It was plain enough&mdash;they intended to start their foray by making me
      a captive so that I could not interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, I made hasty resolution and turned and ran with all my speed
      toward Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s house. I wasn&rsquo;t at all sure just what I intended
      to do, but my impulse was to forewarn the household so that Celene might
      not be frightened. The Skokums came on my heels on the dead jump. But I
      had a good lead of them when I came around the corner of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a man tripped me, pounced on me, and sat on me; I was a submissive
      captive, for the breath was knocked out of me when I fell. The instant the
      Skokums appeared my captor began to shoot off two automatic revolvers. I
      was lying on my back and saw by the flashes that he was shooting into the
      air. The boys had been chasing me rather than intending to rush the house
      at that time, and they broke and fled in all directions, scampering in a
      way which suggested that they were not prepared for artillery defense and
      that the hostilities were over for that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time there was silence, and the man who was sitting on me rose and
      yanked me to my feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a stocky man with a big, black mustache, and he looked savage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound of drawing bolts and Judge Kingsley appeared at his
      office door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the right one, have you, officer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing! He was leading the rush&mdash;ahead of &rsquo;em all. This
      is the chap you told me to follow in the afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge came down the steps and stared into my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the right one&mdash;the ringleader,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew that she was listening above. She must be listening! And other
      folks were flocking outside in the street; that fusillade had been a
      signal as effective as a general fire alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; I cried, full of panic, seeing the position I was in,
      suddenly become the scapegoat of the whole affair. &ldquo;I have done nothing
      wrong. I rushed up here to warn you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You rushed up, all right,&rdquo; declared the detective. &ldquo;Do you think you
      hicks could hold a mass-meeting down in that orchard and fool me as to
      what you were planning to do? I was ready for you. What&rsquo;s orders, Judge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him to the lock-up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      God of the innocent! I&rsquo;ll never forget how that sounded. It was as if
      somebody had hit me on the heart with a hammer. There is some sort of
      dignity about a real prison! But that little, red, wooden coop in our
      village where an occasional drunk was cast in or some lousy hobo harbored&mdash;it
      had always seemed to me and to others such a shameful place&mdash;to leave
      such a badge of utter discredit on the person who had been lodged there!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never go in there! I&rsquo;ll die first,&rdquo; I wailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was telling the bitter truth as I felt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was eager to die in my tracks rather than to have such a foul blot on my
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next instant I had sudden revulsion of feeling in regard to that
      lock-up. In bitter fear, in almost frenzy of apprehension, in default of
      better retreat, I was quite ready to flee to that loathsome coop.
    </p>
    <p>
      For I heard my uncle raving in the street!
    </p>
    <p>
      I never remembered his words; my feelings were too much stirred just then.
      But the hideous screech of rage in his tones I&rsquo;ll never forget. I knew he
      had found out my betrayal of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is going to kill me,&rdquo; I told the detective. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the horse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I reckon he will peel you if he gets his hands on you,&rdquo; stated the
      man, who seemed to know what I was referring to. My uncle was threshing
      his way through the crowd toward me, making slow progress in the jam. The
      detective took advantage of that delay and rushed me off, with Constable
      Nute swinging his key and leading the way. Before I was fairly in my right
      senses I was in the lock-up alone and my two defenders were on guard
      outside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle frothed about the place for an hour, circling the little building
      again and again, plucking at bars and clapboards as a monkey might pick at
      a gigantic nut which resisted his attempts to get at the juicy meat for
      which he was hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had I thought that I would be thankful to be in jail till then!
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, my hopes were sustaining me. I was young and trustful, and I
      was sure that innocence would be victorious. I could not understand how
      anybody would believe that I was guilty when morning came and I could
      explain it all. And I resolved to make some of the Skokums speak up in my
      behalf on threat of exposing the whole gang.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last my uncle went away, staggering and hiccoughing curses&mdash;for he
      had brought his bottle with him and had been consulting it quite often.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fell to wondering whether my innocence would stand me in good stead,
      providing it vindicated me and secured my release from the lock-up? The
      lock-up was surely proving a sanctuary&mdash;and my uncle&rsquo;s threats had
      been horrible ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the crowd which had been hanging around the place with a sort of
      hope, I suppose, that my uncle would be able to get at me, went away, for
      the hour was late. Mr. Detective went, too. So did Constable Nute, who was
      the village night-watch and had his rounds to make. They considered the
      cage a secure one, I suppose, for there were big bolts on the door and
      iron bars on the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat on a stool and mourned my lot as a prisoner, when I was not dreading
      my release to be a victim of my incensed uncle. A good many times I had
      watched Bart Flanders bring a trapped rat up from his cellar and set it
      free in the village square for the entertainment of his terrier. I was in
      a position to sympathize with trapped rats.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence of the night something clicked on the glass of a window and
      a voice outside hailed me cautiously. My first thought was that the
      Skokums had come to rescue me, and I was not especially pleased, for I
      felt that they would be impelled more by the spirit of vandalism than by
      any love for me. I did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the window-frame grunted and squeaked and I saw that somebody was
      prying with a chisel. I rose from the stool and saw the face of Dodovah
      Vose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it that it&rsquo;s another job they have put up on you, young Sidney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is, Mr. Vose,&rdquo; I cried, and I began to whimper. I couldn&rsquo;t help
      it. He spoke as if he understood, as if he were a friend. &ldquo;I was trying to
      stop their devilishness, and they&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t bother about going into details&mdash;not with me, young
      Sidney. I have been watching you lately. You have been a good boy. I know
      you haven&rsquo;t been rampaging round town nights. No matter about telling me
      anything. There&rsquo;s no time to listen. Nute may be drifting back here any
      minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was working with his chisel while he was talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pried a couple of bars out of the rotten wood. He pushed the window up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light out o&rsquo; there!&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I hate to run away, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way things stand now in the village you&rsquo;ll be made the goat,&rdquo; he
      insisted. &ldquo;And if you get clear of the gang part there&rsquo;s your uncle to
      reckon with. He has been stamping around the tavern and telling about you.
      I don&rsquo;t blame him much. What in sanup did you betray own folks for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I couldn&rsquo;t tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After what you did to him you can&rsquo;t expect me and others to say nay if he
      takes it out of your hide. Trigging own folks in a regular hoss dicker
      comes nearer to being a crime than anything the judge can lay against you.
      So you&rsquo;ve got to simplify matters by getting out of town. You mustn&rsquo;t stay
      here and get hurt, son. Climb, I tell ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I climbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He led me down into a lane and pushed me into a top buggy whose curtained
      sides hid me well. He crawled in after me and drove off at a good dip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have written that letter to my brother,&rdquo; he said, after a time. &ldquo;Here
      it is.&rdquo; He put it into my hands. &ldquo;How much money have you got about you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was never at any loss in those days as to my exact financial standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three dollars and sixty-four cents, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is ten more. You must remember to pay it back. It will take you to
      the city and give you a little extra to come and go on. I have backed that
      letter to my brother with full address and directions how to get to the
      Trident Wrecking Company. Mind your eye, keep your money deep in your
      pocket, and go straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I realized that we were on the way to the railroad station at Levant Lower
      Comers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I can to stand up for you in the current talk that will be
      made, young Sidney,&rdquo; said Landlord Vose. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say where you have gone,
      and you can bet that I won&rsquo;t give it out how I helped you to go there. But
      I can tell folks how you have been sitting evenings with me instead of
      cutting up snigdom. I&rsquo;ll help your name what I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been trying to get my tongue loose so as to thank&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to spoiling a good thing at the last minute,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;Come
      back and thank me when we both are sure that this jail-robbing was the
      best thing that could be done under the circumstances. I had only short
      notice and I took a chance that it was the right thing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, after a time, we came to the railroad station, and he left me. I
      sneaked in the shadows till the night train came along.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this fashion I left Levant. Looking ahead or looking behind, I did
      not feel especially joyous.

    <h2>
      VI&mdash;HAVING TO DO WITH JODREY VOSE&rsquo;s MAKING OP A DIVER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> SAT up in the
      smoking-car all night, straight as a cob, making myself as small as I
      could on one of the side seats nearest the door. I was not used to riding
      on a railroad train. At every stop, when men came in and looked at me in
      passing, my heart jumped. Things had been happening pretty fast in my
      case. In the upheaval of my feelings, I was not exactly sure just what
      special crime I had committed. I merely knew that I felt like a
      combination of coward, renegade, and malefactor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea which stuck most painfully in my crop was the certain knowledge
      of what everybody in Levant would be saying&mdash;&ldquo;He had to skip the
      town!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That&rsquo;s a mighty mean tag to be tied to a chap when it&rsquo;s tied on by a
      country community; it never comes off. Even if he makes good in fine shape
      some old blatherskite is always ready to shift his chaw and drool, &ldquo;Maybe
      he&rsquo;s all right <i>now</i>&mdash;but ye have to remember that he had to
      skip the town!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had run away!
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Ase Jepson let drop a remark once which sounded pretty good to
      me: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never run from a bear-fight, because if you lick the bear there&rsquo;s
      the pelt, the steak, the oil, and the reppytation. But who in blazes ever
      got any sensible satisfaction out of sticking to the job and licking a
      nestful of hornets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I got a little satisfaction out of thinking that I had run away from
      hornets, even if they would be sure to call me coward behind my back.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what I knew of the world outside my home town could have been put in
      the eye of a mosquito without making the insect blink. I felt as helpless
      as a wooden shingle latching a furnace door in tophet. I had never seen
      Jodrey Vose. Either I had dreamed it or had heard that he was considered a
      pretty hard ticket in his early days. As a diver, a man who passed much of
      his time under water in the mysteries of the sea, he seemed to me like
      something unreal. I studied the superscription on the letter and felt as
      if I were carrying a line of introduction to a bullfrog.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so I went bumping on toward somewhere, my thoughts heavy and my
      possessions mighty light; I hadn&rsquo;t even a clean handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had not so many bigger matters to hurry on to in this tale, I&rsquo;d like
      to describe how I was all of two days locating the Trident Wrecking
      Company and Jodrey Vose, after I arrived in the city. The folks in Levant
      always seemed to think I was a cheeky youngster, and I guess I was, to a
      certain extent. I had plenty of temper and when I wanted a thing I always
      had to go and get it&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t handed to me. But in that big city I
      was more meeching than a scared pup in a boiler-factory.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no idea how large a real city was, anyway. Furthermore, all of a
      sudden, I found myself becoming very crafty, according to my own
      reckoning. I had decided that I was a fugitive from justice and that every
      policeman was on the watch for me. Therefore I avoided policemen, turning
      comers whenever I saw brass buttons. As I looked on everybody else in the
      hurrying multitude as a sharper, on the hunt for country picking, that
      left me without anybody to question. I had my nose in the air and must
      have sniffed the water-front after a time. At any rate, I found myself
      down there, dodging drays, tramping dirty alleys and as completely lost as
      a bug in a brush-pile.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lived on chestnuts because I found men selling them on the street. I
      drank water from horse-fountains. After I walked all day and most of the
      night, and napped for a while, standing up against a building in a dark
      corner, I began to feel more or less like a horse; I had eaten so much dry
      fodder and had gulped so much water! There were many adventures, of
      course, but I have already stated why I may not deal with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Staggering from weariness, I fairly bumped, at last, into a door which was
      labeled: &ldquo;Trident Wrecking Company, Anson C. Doughty, General Manager.&rdquo;
       This was no accident. I reckon I had tramped all the waterfront and had
      read all the signs except that one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went into the outer office, holding my letter by one corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody paid any attention to me for half an hour. There were men writing
      in big books behind a counter, and finally I pushed the letter over to one
      of them who had stopped to light a cigar. He pushed it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where will I find him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. He&rsquo;s a diver. They don&rsquo;t do their diving here in the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was not a place in that office where I could sit and I was so tired
      I was sick. The man turned his back on me and I did not dare to ask him
      any more questions. I backed away from the counter and stood in the middle
      of the floor, swaying and blinking. I reckon I must have looked like a
      down-and-out bum. At any rate, when a big man came showing a caller out of
      a door labeled &ldquo;General Manager, Private,&rdquo; he bumped against me when I did
      not get out of the road and almost knocked me down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose it was due to my state of mind and body&mdash;but till that
      moment I had never felt what ugly, vicious hatred&mdash;desire to kill&mdash;meant.
      The feeling came up in me so suddenly that I was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big man went right on with his friend and took no notice of me. He had
      hairy hands which he flourished as he talked, and the coat of his brown
      suit had long tails which ended in a sort of scallop at his knees, behind;
      it came to me in the flush of my boiling hatred that he looked like a fat
      cockroach. And that bump dealt to me when I was so miserable, that
      suggestion of the cockroach which always popped up at me as long as I knew
      him, later made for another decisive turning-point in my life. Again I am
      calling attention to the fact that matters which I did not reckon on as to
      amounting to much at the moment have been my mile-stones. As I look back I
      recognize the mile-stones, though I could not distinguish them at the
      time. For instance, if you keep on with me far enough, I shall tell you
      how an affair which counted, perhaps, as the biggest crisis in my life was
      dominated by a plain, ordinary monkey with an artificial tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed after that big man with a raging desire to kick him under the
      sleek tads of that coat&mdash;to pound my fists into his fat back. I might
      have given quite an account of myself, at that, for I was full grown at
      twenty and as hard as hickory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I say,&rdquo; I heard before he slammed the door behind him, &ldquo;you better
      come along with me down to Trull wharf and talk to Vose himself. He can
      tell you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gathered my wits and chased along behind. The two of them paid as little
      attention to me as they would to a prowling cat. But if they were on the
      way to talk to &ldquo;Vose himself,&rdquo; that surely was my opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some distance and by way of devious alleys, but we came at last to
      where a lighter was tied beside a wharf.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a derrick and the scow was loaded with blocks of granite. A man
      was slowly and ceaselessly turning the wheel of a queer-looking machine,
      another was carefully handling hose which passed over the side of the
      lighter and down into the water, and still another was tending ropes. It
      did not occur to me at first what this activity indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the big man called out, &ldquo;Is Vose about due to come up?&rdquo; I
      understood at once and was mightily interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked down into the dock and saw water like liquid muck, filled with
      floating refuse, and a good deal of the glamour of a diver&rsquo;s life departed
      from my imagination. Somehow I had thought that Jodrey Vose spent his days
      in blue depths of pure ocean water, looking around at strange fishes and
      exploring mysterious caves. That he was obliged to go down into any such
      mess as that and work on blocks of stones with his two hands was a
      depressing discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time there was a bubbling of the turbid water close beside the
      lighter, and for the first time in my life I saw a diver&rsquo;s helmet emerge;
      the goggling eye-plates, the grotesque excrescences, the sprouting antennæ
      of the hose lines, the venomous hissing of the air from the vents&mdash;it
      all seemed uncanny, and made me shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men reached down to help him up the ladder, and when he was on deck in
      full view, scuffing his huge, weighted shoes, a balloon-like creature, as
      shapeless as the doughnut men my mother used to cut for me when she was in
      good humor on frying-day, I was sure I had never seen so curious a sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he sat down they twisted off the helmet, and the fat man, whom I
      reckoned must be Manager Anson C. Doughty, escorted the other man aboard
      the lighter and the three started a conversation which I could not hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew the diver for Jodrey Vose because I had seen his picture at the
      tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business, whatever it was, did not take much time and the manager and
      the other man went away. Helpers began to shuck the diver from his suit;
      it was nearing sundown and work for the day was over, it seemed. When he
      was free from the bulk of the stuff and was starting for the cabin of the
      lighter I went to him and gave him the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Dod, hey?&rdquo; Then he told me to follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him while he read the letter by the light of a bracket lamp.
      He was a wiry man with a twist of grizzled chin-beard. I was much
      comforted when he looked up from the letter and grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben Sidney&rsquo;s boy! Well, your father was the only critter on two legs in
      Levant, in the old days, who could stand in a barrel, like I could, and
      jump out without touching the sides. You look as if you have some of his
      spryness and grit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, sir. I have always worked at what has come to my hands to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dod says business is a mite slow in Levant and that you want a job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now there was gratitude in me as well as comfort; it was evident that
      Dodovah Vose had not written that I was a runaway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The diver laid down the letter and went fumbling for his street clothes in
      a closet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, you can come up to my boarding-place with me for the night
      and we&rsquo;ll talk it all over,&rdquo; he said, in a very kind way. &ldquo;If you had only
      made yourself known a few minutes ago I could have introduced you to
      Manager Anson C. Doughty. But to-morrow will do as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not dare to offer comment. I wondered what there was about Anson C.
      Doughty to keep my hatred of him so stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He takes my recommendations as to my helpers,&rdquo; said Vose. &ldquo;There is one
      thing a diver has to be sure about&mdash;that&rsquo;s picking his helpers. We&rsquo;ll
      talk it over, I say. If I find there&rsquo;s considerable of Ben Sidney in you,
      I reckon we can make a go of it. Have you a hankering to learn the
      business, itself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I blossomed under the warmth of this kindness, I was full of words by that
      time. I hadn&rsquo;t opened my mouth to talk for two days. I told him about my
      evenings in that tavern, my poring over his curios, my ambitions, my
      dreams and hopes after hearing the stories his brother had to tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished dressing he clapped me on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I calculate you&rsquo;re going to do,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get your
      expectations too high. I have given up all the deep work&mdash;too old.
      Five or six years steady at deep work finishes a man. I have nursed myself
      along. Wharf work&mdash;fifteen to thirty feet&mdash;that&rsquo;s my limit these
      days. But I like your spirit, son. Can&rsquo;t find boys in the city like that!
      I should say that you&rsquo;ve got the real hankering. Cigarettes, ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir! No tobacco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No cider jamborees? No express packages from the city?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Vose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! I reckon I&rsquo;ll keep the old town of Levant on the map in the diving
      line. I know the game, my boy. And I know how to teach it to the right
      kind of a pupil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you do, Mr. Vose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we&rsquo;ll talk it all over this evening&mdash;and while we&rsquo;re about it, if
      you don&rsquo;t call me Captain Vose down this way they&rsquo;ll think you don&rsquo;t know
      me very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I blushed, then I followed him out and away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I tumbled into bed that night we had settled upon the future so far
      as our words to each other went; the bargain only needed the ratification
      of Anson C. Doughty&mdash;and that was secured next morning. I had
      expected that sleep would soothe my nerves and remove my ugly grouch in
      the case of that gentleman. However, there must have been something
      instinctive in my dislike for him; he looked me up and down and caught my
      scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have picked out a pretty surly up-country steer, Vose!
      However, put him to work if you like that kind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So to work I went.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cleaned diving-suits and thus became familiar with the parts and the
      mechanism. I soaked out mud-caked ropes, I tended lines and learned
      signals, and was always busy with a hundred other odd jobs as a satellite
      of Diver Vose. He used me well enough, though he was never as warm toward
      me as he was at our first meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some weeks I lost my fear that I would be followed and taken back to
      Levant. I was not sure whether I felt more relief than rancor. To be
      considered as not worth chasing, to know they were saying &ldquo;Good riddance!&rdquo;
       behind my back, gave me thoughts which hurt a certain kind of pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was afraid of the city and I went nowhere except to my work and to my
      boarding-place. So there was an epoch in my life which was bare of
      adventure until Diver Vose sent me down for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had given me a fine course of sprouts previously, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in spite of all that the first sensations nigh paralyzed me. I reached
      bottom and wallowed around without the least thought or remembrance
      regarding what I had been told to do. A freight-train seemed to be roaring
      around inside my helmet and I was gasping like a dying skate-fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in scuffing around in a sort of panic, taking no care of what I was
      about, I hooked my shoe onto something and began to yank and thresh around
      in a perfect frenzy. The result was that I pulled the shoe off and my
      lightened foot was snapped above my head in a finer spread-eagle than any
      acrobatic dancer ever pulled off. To drag that foot down was beyond my
      powers, and I tripped and went onto my back. Being up-ended is a diver&rsquo;s
      chief peril, because the air bellies up into the legs of the dress and
      leaves scant supply in the helmet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that crisis there was one idea which stuck to me: I must get that lost
      shoe!
    </p>
    <p>
      And I did get it. I groped and rolled and struggled and pulled until I did
      get it. A half-dozen times in my efforts I felt them trying to haul me up.
      I suppose I must have given signals telling them to quit that. I fought
      them as best I could, anyway, until I had recovered the shoe; then I
      yanked for a lift and went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Vose was standing in front of me with the helmet in his hands when
      I had recovered my wits enough to notice anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been dancing a jig?&rdquo; he inquired, caustically.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head, for I was not able to utter words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which did you lose first down there, your nerve or that shoe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I hesitated, he snapped, &ldquo;Give me the truth, now, or we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get
      along after this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My nerve!&rdquo; I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I knew&mdash;for I lashed on that shoe with my own hands. Very well!
      What good are you as a diver without your wits or your nerve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No good, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can buy an eighteen-pound shoe at any equipment loft. But how about
      buying nerve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon it can&rsquo;t be bought, sir,&rdquo; I confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, you were almighty <i>particular</i>,&rdquo; he sneered, &ldquo;to bring back
      that shoe with you even if you didn&rsquo;t bring your nerve. Left your nerve on
      the bottom, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was mighty nasty in his tone and his manner, and the men standing
      around were grinning. Perhaps even all that would not have put grit back
      into me, for I was dizzy and scared and was owning up to myself that I was
      better fitted for dry ground than a wet sea-bottom. But just then Anson C.
      Doughty bellowed from the wharf:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, look here, Vose, let that coward go back upcountry to his steers! We
      have no time to fool away on greenhorns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did leave my nerve on the bottom I&rsquo;m going back after it, and I&rsquo;m
      going right now!&rdquo; I told the diver. I was holding the shoe and I dropped
      it on deck and shoved my foot into it. Captain Vose kneeled and began to
      lash it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing, there?&rdquo; demanded the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Making a diver,&rdquo; stated my teacher, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m paying you fifty dollars a day to do what I tell you to do, Vose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, sir!&rdquo; The captain kept right on with the lashings. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      a contract between you and this young man which tells me to teach him how
      to be a diver, if he shows the capacity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t shown it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is going to in about five minutes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He picked up the helmet and bent over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a reason for twitting you about that shoe,&rdquo; he said, in my ear.
      &ldquo;You showed what was in you by bringing it back If you hadn&rsquo;t brought it
      back I would have stripped this suit off you and sent you hipering! You&rsquo;ve
      got it in you! You&rsquo;re all right! Now go down, son, and set that chain
      where I told you to set it. The first scare is the vaccination for this
      kind of work. You&rsquo;re in a way to be immune from now on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last sound I heard was the snarl of Anson C. Doughty. That sound
      helped me to go to my job that day. I went down and did what was required
      of me, and, as I worked below there and became convinced that there was
      nothing to harm me if I kept my head, I found my nerve, I reckon, for good
      and all, in the diving business.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now that this story seems to be settled into a rut of adventure in my
      chosen line of work, hold breath with me and prepare for a couple of most
      &ldquo;jeeroosly jounces,&rdquo; as old Wagner Bangs used to term his occasional falls
      from his state of natural grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, I leap as nimbly as I can over three years and a half of hard work,
      the story of which would hold as little interest as the biography of a
      mud-clam. I slipped and slid and dug in slime, I shagged granite blocks
      and dragged chains, I pried into wrecks and had my whack at fumbling in
      the watery shadows for the drowned&mdash;pitiful bundles floating as if
      they were attempting posthumous gymnastics, head down and fingers trying
      to touch toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did &ldquo;deep work&rdquo; on ticklish jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I came into the fifty-dollar-a-day class of workers, to the grim
      content of my mentor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just remarked that the snarl of Anson C. Doughty sent me in earnest
      to my first job. Also, just as suddenly, that snarl pried me loose from my
      job.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish I did not have to confess what I have to say now. I come to jounce
      number two!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have spoken a ways back of mile-stones in my life and suggested that
      Anson C. Doughty was connected with one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish I could give a real, compelling, manly reason why I tossed my hopes
      and my prospects so wildly into the air all of a sudden. I have spoken of
      my ready temper&mdash;but that&rsquo;s no reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fifteen seconds I shifted the life I was living as completely as a
      derailing-switch shoots a runaway engine off the main line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The borers of that mysterious hatred for Anson C. Doughty must have been
      burrowing in me all the time, even as those little teredinoid bivalves we
      call ship-worms gnaw into submerged piles with the edges of their shells.
      I was full of burrows and went to pieces all of a sudden.
    </p>
    <p>
      For I came up one day out of thirty fathoms&mdash;and that&rsquo;s man&rsquo;s work&mdash;and
      Doughty was giving me green help out of his general meanness&mdash;and my
      head was far from steady; in addition he gave me his snarl for the last
      time, instead of snarling at his infernal dubs who were risking my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped on his foot with a shoe that was loaded with twenty pounds of
      lead&mdash;and that&rsquo;s some anchor!&mdash;I walloped him into insensibility
      with the end of a rubber hose. Then I resigned informally, while he lay on
      the deck of the lighter, grunting back to life again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody stopped me when I said I was going and announced that it would be
      dangerous to get in my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood back while I shifted my clothes&mdash;and I got away with my
      diving equipment, even! It was the newest thing out for those days and the
      going styles of gear, and I had paid good money for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say again, I wish I had a more cogent reason to give for throwing up my
      work. But I&rsquo;m giving the truth of the matter. I left just that way. I knew
      that Anson C. Doughty would have me put in jail if he could catch me. I
      knew that I couldn&rsquo;t do any more diving, for divers are marked men and are
      easily located. It was up to me to go and hide; so I went and hid.
    </p>

      VII&mdash;THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A PLUG-HAT|
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> HAD been about a
      bit during three years and a half. I own up frankly that I had found out
      that I had more or less of a cheap streak in me. I&rsquo;m not disguising it
      wholly by the name of curiosity; though, of course, a country fellow has a
      keen hankering to look in on some of the sights of the big city.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we boys up in Levant used to hand around among ourselves by stealth
      some of the flashy papers, I didn&rsquo;t believe there were such things as I
      read in print and saw in pictures. After some of my sporty associates of
      the Trident workers began to take me around with them evenings I kept
      perfectly still about my earlier disbeliefs, and my cheap streak began to
      talk up to me. Somebody came distributing free admission cards to
      concerts, managed by religious and fraternal bodies&mdash;but I preferred
      to pay money at the door of a burlesque theater. I liked to go scouting in
      dance-halls, and I haunted low resorts to hear what I could hear and see
      what I could see.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went boldly, for we were husky youths. As for myself, I had licked the
      boys of Levant at every opportunity&mdash;and my Sidney temper afforded me
      opportunities aplenty. I was never afraid when I went about alone, either.
      I had a rather quiet way of minding my own business and impressing it on
      the other fellow that he&rsquo;d better mind his.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, it may be guessed, most of my wanderings had been done in the lower
      quarters of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      That&rsquo;s where I went to hide. And I had knowledge enough of the locality to
      hide myself effectually and keep hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did get in touch with one of the fellows who had been around a great
      deal with me and whom I trusted&mdash;for he had no special use for Anson
      C. Doughty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anson C. Doughty was out of doors once more, after spending a week of
      retirement in the company of a few busy little leeches, and, as to eyes
      and nose, he was not looking so very badly on the outside, but was
      evidently having a great amount of trouble with a volcano raging within,
      so my informant told me. Mr. Doughty was proclaiming that he proposed to
      catch me so that he could make an example for the sake of discipline in
      his crews in the future; but according to the program he had promulgated,
      he proposed to cut me up with a meatchopper before turning me over to the
      law. So I decided to keep under cover for an indefinite period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I sent word to Captain Jodrey Vose and had him call on me in my
      castle, because I did not want him to think that he had wasted all his
      efforts when he had made me a diver.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the captain did seem to think so. He frankly said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get another job diving on the Atlantic coast,&rdquo; he told me.
      &ldquo;In the first place, you won&rsquo;t dare to show up as a diver where Anson C.
      Doughty can grab you. In the next place, Anson C. Doughty has posted you
      with all the wrecking companies as being as dangerous as an Asiatic tiger
      with lighted kerosene on his tail. Now tell me what made you do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me with his eyes squizzled up and a frown on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting along in years and I&rsquo;m probably losing my mind to some
      extent,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll be cussed if I believe I&rsquo;ve got entire
      softening of the brain. It must be that I&rsquo;m deaf and can&rsquo;t understand&mdash;because
      I don&rsquo;t get the least idea of why you did it to him. Tell it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I must have softening of the brain,&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a
      riddle-come-ree to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same to me&mdash;and that&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t explain,&rdquo; I told him,
      frankly. &ldquo;I hung onto myself all that time, wanting to do it, and then I
      let go and did it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About as you went to cutting up in Levant before you skipped out,&rdquo; he
      snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to that time, not by word or look had he let me know that he had any
      knowledge of why I had left my home town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dod explained it to me in the letter he sent with you. But he had excuses
      to give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had to admire Captain Vose&rsquo;s ability to keep his thoughts to himself, as
      I remembered the placid countenance he showed to me when he had read that
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I reckon that Dod was prejudiced in your favor and that you had been
      a young devil the folks wanted to boost out of town. Dod&rsquo;s judgment was
      never very good in the case of any critters who were willing to cater to
      him. I don&rsquo;t suppose you dare to go back up there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go.&rdquo; But all of a sudden a queer wave of homesickness
      seemed to come swelling up in me and to choke me like water chokes the
      throat of a dredge-pump. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done with that town for good and all,&rdquo; I
      told him. &ldquo;I got along all right while I was doing dirt as fast as the
      rest of &rsquo;em, but when I tried to be decent they didn&rsquo;t give me a
      show!&rdquo; I snapped my finger. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t give <i>that</i> for anybody in
      Levant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew I was lying and I think Jodrey Vose knew it, for he was a keen old
      chap. He scowled at me and grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got any money left after all the rake-helling you&rsquo;ve been doing for a
      year past?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he knew all about that, too!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fixed all right!&rdquo; But I looked up at the ceiling of my room when I
      said it, and I knew I was not fooling him. I ought to have had a bank
      account, considering what I had been pulling down. I had all my capital in
      my pocket&mdash;a roll about as big as my thumb. I had considerable of a
      string of memories, such as they were, regarding money I had spent; I had
      a brand-new diving dress, and, above all, queer as this may sound, I had a
      specially new outfit which was my chief pride: a frock-coat and pearl-gray
      trousers, waistcoat modestly fancy&mdash;my real tastes in that direction
      having been gently suppressed by an honest tailor&mdash;and a plug-hat
      whose shininess fairly put my eyes out. And up to that time I had had no
      opportunity to wear that suit except in front of the mirror in my
      hiding-place!
    </p>
    <p>
      I had tested the tilt of that hat at a dozen different angles; I had
      nearly broken my neck in efforts to see just how the coat-tails flared in
      the back. With a chart as help, a card stuck in the side of the mirror, I
      had practised tying a scarf in Ascot style until my staring eyes watered
      and my fingers ached. Then I had walked back and forth, trying to get the
      hang of a cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I suggest that this may sound queer. But it was only another
      manifestation of that cheap streak in me, so I reckon. I was not modeling
      my appearance on the looks of any real gentleman I had ever seen; I had
      not bought that garb in order to appear at church or to climb into better
      society. But from the time I was ten years old I had nursed one special,
      hungry, despairing ambition. At the county fair I saw &ldquo;Diamond Dick&rdquo;
       Shrady marshaling his painted beauties in front of his tent, and,
      according to my notion, his rig-out was apparel which shaded even the
      robes of royalty. I could not conceive higher height of happiness than to
      own and wear for &ldquo;every day&rdquo; a suit like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the lily&mdash;as I considered &ldquo;Diamond Dick&rdquo;! Then consider me
      as I stood in front of that tent!
    </p>
    <p>
      I had on brogan shoes which I had fresh-tallowed for the day. My stockings
      were home-knit and bulged out in folds over the tops of my shoes. But I
      was not so keenly self-conscious of my footwear as of the rest of my
      outfit, because Levant boys wore brogans quite commonly. My trousers were
      my special sore point, for even in Levant they had been ridiculed. In the
      first place, the cloth was a glazy, stiff stuff; in the second place, my
      good mother did not understand how to cut out a boy&rsquo;s pants. There was
      just as much fullness in the front as in the seat. I kept denting in that
      fullness with my fists when I was unobserved. I found that by stooping
      quite a bit when I walked or stood I was able to keep the fullness caved
      in and less noticeable. It was a wonder I did not become permanently
      humpbacked while I was wearing out those pants. The legs of them were like
      twin stovepipes, and almost as unyielding. They crackled at the knees when
      I sat down. Add to those items of attire a hickory shirt, for which I had
      made a false bosom out of a shingle painted white, a paper collar, and a
      butterfly bow made of a gingham rag, a hard hat which was a paternal
      hand-me-down; they called them &ldquo;dips.&rdquo; It was a good name. The hat was
      exactly the shape of the bowl of a table-spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I leaned back and gaped up at that gorgeous stranger on the platform,
      straightening myself and letting my forward fullness swell as it would,
      there was born in me that unconquerable hankering&mdash;wild desire to be
      dressed like that&mdash;sometime! To say to myself&mdash;sometime&mdash;&ldquo;Now
      I am dressed right! Everything about me is just as it should be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To base my ideas on the outfit &ldquo;Diamond Dick&rdquo; wore was probably evidence
      of the cheap streak in me, I say, but when you consider me as I stood
      there, and then consider the lily, is there not some excuse?
    </p>
    <p>
      I confess with some shame that during my hiding in the city, while I was
      tucked away in that boarding-house room, my chief regret was not that I
      was out of a job, was not that I had battered the face of my employer, but
      was because I could not go out and swell around the streets and the
      amusement places wearing that suit and looking that picture of myself
      which had been the ideal that lulled me to sleep every night during my
      boyhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was having some of those dreams while I sat there and gazed up at the
      ceiling. At last a big dream had come true. I owned that suit and I knew I
      looked mighty well in it. I had put in a good many hours in front of the
      looking-glass making sure of that fact. But now that I owned it I was
      getting none of the thrills and but little of the satisfaction I had
      looked forward to. Realized ambitions in my case&mdash;and probably it&rsquo;s
      true in most cases&mdash;have always seemed to have a lot of discomforting
      tag-ends tied to them. I was practically a prisoner in a dingy room, I
      could not go out and sport around in my new regalia, and Jodrey Vose, who
      had undertaken to make a man of me, was sitting across the table, scowling
      at me with a great deal of disfavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you taken up drinking along with the rest, young Sidney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; and I never shall. I&rsquo;m sure of that, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go back to Levant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dod writes that your uncle has been enlarging his business and is making
      a lot of money and is going to run for town office. He must need a chap
      like you and has probably forgotten any little trouble he might have had
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t expect me to do anything more for you, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again I shook my head. That homesick feeling was swelling up once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear that they are fitting out another Cocos Island expedition to hunt
      for the Peru treasure-ship. You might be able to sign on there. But it&rsquo;s a
      fake job. There&rsquo;s no sunken ship. However, you&rsquo;ll get wages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll try the Pacific coast, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slid his forefinger back and forth slowly under his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might do, son. I have thought of the same jump, myself. I have waited
      now till I&rsquo;m too old. What started me thinking about it some years ago was
      the <i>Golden Gate</i> proposition. What troubled me about making up my
      mind was that some said the treasure had been got out of her and others
      said there was some guesswork. Nobody seemed to be willing to produce any
      proof that the treasure was still there. Looking back, I can see now why
      all interested parties would naturally rather have it thought that the
      treasure wasn&rsquo;t there. But when a fellow like me has his living to make he
      doesn&rsquo;t want to take too many chances. And the one job I did go on
      sickened me of treasure-hunting on somebody&rsquo;s guesswork.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry you are in your scrape, young Sidney. You&rsquo;re done for as a
      diver in these parts for a time. Try the Pacific. I don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s a bad
      idea.&rdquo; He grinned at me. &ldquo;If you recover the <i>Golden Gate</i> treasure
      drop me a postal card.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went away, making no more ado about the matter of our parting. I
      was not surprised by that manner of leave-taking. I am a Yankee myself,
      and I had found myself wishing that when he went he would walk off without
      jawing me or coddling me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I counted my money and sent out for some railroad folders and trailed my
      finger across the map&mdash;and stayed right on in the city, week after
      week. I don&rsquo;t know exactly what I had lost&mdash;ambition or pluck or what
      it was! But that was a spell in my life when I was a plumb, square loafer,
      and rather enjoyed myself&mdash;reading cheap novels and playing solitaire
      in the daytime, then getting in with some of the rest of the boarders and
      playing poker evenings. In Levant we used to play for beans in
      barn-chambers. I had a country boy&rsquo;s shrewdness in that game, and the city
      fellows did not get much of my money away from me; nor did I get any
      particular amount of theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the pastime did bring me into touch with some sporting characters
      and with some queer characters, too. There were men who were hiding the
      same as I was. The fact that I was under cover gave me open sesame to
      their confidence. They talked a great deal, whiling away dull hours in the
      day. Several were in the house where I was stopping, and after a time I
      dared to go visiting around a bit evenings and went along to other houses,
      in the locality.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all new to me, this &ldquo;flash&rdquo; side of fife, and I listened to their
      stories with eyes and mouth open. I conceived an idea of writing out these
      stories into a book, and after I got back into my room nights I would jot
      down all I had heard, names and all. I had all the nicknames of operators
      down pat&mdash;those names rather fascinated me. There were names which
      were based on personal peculiarities or blemishes or system of operating.
      I found out that a great many of the parties were linked, either by
      relationship or by gang ties, and that the wise boys among the crooks or
      the police officers could tell in many cases just what crowd had operated,
      providing the identity of one man could be revealed. I reckon I calculated
      in those times that I was going to make an exposé, for I made many notes
      about the different coteries and their associates.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will say at this point that I have no intention of writing such a book,
      and I have gone into a bit of detail about the matter in order that
      certain following activities of mine may be understood. Otherwise, I
      might, later on, be thought to be advertising myself as one of those
      know-it-all and do-it-all heroes of fiction instead of a plain and
      ordinary chap who has been swayed by circumstance and governed by accident
      in large measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I did get a lot of fresh and lively information out of those chaps
      with whom I was thrown in.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time they were not at all bashful about asking me if I wouldn&rsquo;t
      like a lay in some of their operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      They frankly said that they had the best luck in country communities.
      Understand that they proposed nothing except brace games! No safe-breakers
      in that lot! They said I had an honest way about me that would take well
      in the country districts.
    </p>
    <p>
      My money was getting so low I listened with increasing interest. I cannot
      say that I was tempted, exactly. But I was beginning to wonder how I was
      ever going to make a go of it if I didn&rsquo;t get some money. My Pacific trip
      was all off by that time! My capital had shrunk below the price of a
      ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      They told me that a regular village skinflint with lots of money was, in
      most cases, a prime victim if the right bait was offered; with the right
      bait he bit more easily than the more liberal kind of an individual,
      because the skinflint was more crazy to make money fast and was already
      used to getting high rates of interest for all money he let out. They were
      making constant search for old chaps in country communities, well-to-do
      men who would be tempted to grab at a rich chance or could be induced to
      serve as decoys to pull in the neighbors, provided a sufficient rake-off
      were offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, too, was another thing which surprised me&mdash;that so often
      really prominent men could be secured as decoys. The knaves I was training
      with gave me a lot of stories of the kind; in most cases, so they said,
      the men seemed to talk themselves into believing that they were offering
      the neighbors an opportunity to make money.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had not been idle and very curious, and all the time wondering how I
      could make a little money for myself, a lot of this would have gone into
      one ear and out of the other.. But I was in the mood to take it all in,
      and so, in that foolish belief that I could write a story, I set down many
      names and many instances until I had well filled a sheaf of papers which I
      sewed together into a sort of note-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were various side-lines of the craft of cheaters where I was allowed
      to be an observer. I watched one of the chaps make up his face for a trip
      and learned about false beards attached by spirit gum. There was a cute
      little mustache in his kit and I asked him to affix it to my upper lip. He
      allowed me to keep it on when I asked permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt so much confidence in that alteration of my features that I went
      directly to my room, put on that raiment of my yearning ambition, took in
      hand my cane, and went forth into the open.
    </p>
    <p>
      One who has remained long within-doors gets used to the confinement after
      a time and the desire to go out is dulled; there are persons who have
      voluntarily remained in bed in perfect health for years; but, once the
      plunge outside is made, the desire for further liberty grows by what it
      grasps in the blessedness of outdoors. I determined to be free from then
      on and to test the quality of that freedom. It was astonishing what
      confidence I felt in myself when I walked abroad in that rig, casting
      side-glances at myself in store windows as I walked. It is amazing what
      the right sort of clothes will do for a man&rsquo;s grip and grit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went down to the docks and walked about, deliberately seeking to put
      myself in the path of Anson C. Doughty. He did come face to face with me
      after a time, looked at me with considerable interest, for plug-hats were
      none too common in that locality, and passed on with bland indifference.
      My transition was too much for him; I was the butterfly that had emerged
      from the pupa of a diving-dress. After that I bestowed no further thought
      on dangers to be apprehended from Anson C. Doughty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was more concerned with speculation on where my next meal was coming
      from, for I was flat broke. I suppose that fact had something to do with
      driving me out on the street; it was not wholly proud eagerness to show
      myself in that suit of clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of a sudden I received direct proof that a plug-hat is occasionally
      something to conjure by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it is on the principle that advertising pays; a man with slick,
      silk headgear is supposed to be at least something which can be classed
      under the title of &ldquo;professor.&rdquo; At any rate, I was hailed by that title by
      a man who stood in a broad doorway. I stopped and he had something
      interesting to say to me.

    <h2>
      VIII&mdash;&ldquo;TAKING IT OUT&rdquo; ON A SUIT OF CLOTHES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HAT doorway was
      solidly banked with banners frescoed in gaudy colors and roughly painted;
      they advertised a show within. A few glances I had time to give while I
      walked toward the man who had hailed me, revealed that there were on tap
      such features as &ldquo;Petrified Mormon Giant,&rdquo; &ldquo;Siamese Susie,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mammoth
      Peruvian Cockatoo,&rdquo; and others. Over the door was heralded in big letters:
      &ldquo;Dawlin&rsquo;s Mammoth Wonder Show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I guessed that the man in the doorway might be Dawlin. He wore a corduroy
      suit, with gaiters, and a broad-brimmed cowboy hat was canted on one side
      of his head. By the way in which he was looking me over I could see that I
      was suiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hitched up with a show?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him that I was not, and I said it with considerable curtness. To be
      sure, the personality and garb of Showman Shrady had formed my early
      ideal, and I ought to have felt gratified, I suppose, when this man took
      me for a showman. But I was pricked a little by the thought that my
      appearance seemed to grade me on that plane. &ldquo;Want to hitch on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think I&rsquo;m in the show business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had you sized that way on account of the scenery.&rdquo; I gathered that he
      meant my clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any circus signs on this suit of mine,&rdquo; I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, say, I didn&rsquo;t mean to offend&mdash;but it&rsquo;s usually only sports and
      professionals who tog that way down in this part of the town. If you&rsquo;re a
      gent you seem to be off your beat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing offensive about the man&mdash;he seemed a good-humored
      chap who was a little cheeky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what if I had been a showman&mdash;what about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to offer you a lay&mdash;here at the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Selling tickets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gad, no, man! I want you for the spiel&mdash;for the oratory&mdash;tongue-work&mdash;hooking
      the hicks! You&rsquo;re rigged out just right. You must know that the better the
      front we put on at the door, the better the business inside! But excuse me
      if I got the tags shifted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I swung my cane with one hand and with the other hand in my pocket sifted
      coins through my fingers. There were not many coins. I needed more in a
      hurry. It had been impressed on me that in spite of all my pride in my
      attire I did not look like a &ldquo;gent&rdquo;; it was certain that I did not feel
      like one. Disappointment was curdling pride in me; my clothes had gone
      back on me. I entertained a sort of a grudge against them. All of a sudden
      I made up my mind to get back at those garments which had cost me so much
      money and now repaid me in contentment so niggardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be all new business for me. Can I do it, do you suppose?&rdquo; I
      asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks are half the battle. You&rsquo;ve got capital in your clothes to start
      with. You don&rsquo;t look like a souse! The last two I have had on the door
      pawned their rigs for rum. I&rsquo;ve got the patter stuff all written out. All
      you&rsquo;ve got to do is study it and reel it off like you used to recite
      pieces in school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing surrender in my face, he winked and crooked his finger in
      invitation to me to follow him inside. He led me into a narrow little
      office. He offered a drink and a cigar, and I refused both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee! Some principles, hey? Now, if you&rsquo;re a church member I reckon you
      won&rsquo;t stand for the lay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m devilish far from being a church member,&rdquo; I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to open up too much till I know a little something about
      you. Can you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him enough to make him pretty much at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know any of the right kind in this locality&mdash;the sporting
      bunch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave a roster of acquaintances that made his eyes glisten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then, you&rsquo;re all right!&rdquo; he cried, slapping my knee. &ldquo;In <i>my</i>
      business a fellow has to try the ice before he slides out too far. I&rsquo;m
      coming right across to you.&rdquo; He waved his hand to indicate his
      establishment. &ldquo;This show is only a hinkumginny, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; I said, calmly. I hadn&rsquo;t the least idea what he meant, but
      I knew that one needed to act wise with wise gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We run the gazara game and phrenology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded and winked an eye as if I had been quite sure of that fact right
      along.
    </p>
    <p>
      He scratched a few figures on a wisp of paper and pushed it to me across
      the desk-slide on which he had set out the whisky-glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the split,&rdquo; he said, grinning. Still it was all Greek to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know places doing half our business and paying twice as much&mdash;and
      every once in a while having to settle a squeal, at that! But I&rsquo;ve got a
      cousin at headquarters&mdash;see? Nothing to it! Now you can understand
      what a sweet little pudding you&rsquo;re pulling alongside of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was wishing I could understand better, though I was developing a dim
      notion that he was talking about money paid for protection from the law.
      He pulled back the paper and tore it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only fifty a week,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing. I&rsquo;m thinking of throwing in
      another twenty-five without their asking. It beats laying up treasures in
      heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now as to a lay for you! Of course, first of all, I have to grab off my
      fifty of the net&mdash;it&rsquo;s my show and my pull! Then there&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Prof&rsquo;&mdash;Professor
      Jewelle. He has his twenty-five per cent. I&rsquo;ll tell you straight, now, I
      have been getting by with those dickerdoodles I&rsquo;ve had out on the stand
      for fifteen per cent., and &lsquo;prof&rsquo; and I have divided the other ten. But
      they were crumby! Their suits were wrinkled worse than an elephant&rsquo;s
      dewlap, and the nap of their plug-hats was fruzzled up like the fur in the
      mane of the Australian witherlick. No pull to that class! The jaspers
      jogged right past without being a mite impressed. If you grab in with us
      your looks and your style make you worth a lay of twenty-five per cent.
      Now what say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll grab,&rdquo; I told him, and never did a man hire with less idea of just
      what kind of a business he was entering or what pay he was going to get
      for his labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say your name is Ross Sidney,&rdquo; said the boss, remembering what I had
      told him. &ldquo;Mine is Jeff Dawlin, Ross, and there&rsquo;s no mistering among
      partners.&rdquo; He gave me a few dirty sheets of paper. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s your spiel all
      written out. You can add your own talk as you work into the spirit of the
      thing. The idea is get them to stop, look, listen&mdash;and then coax till
      they come in. If they come out squealing, you go on and bawl them&mdash;bawl
      them down! There&rsquo;s some good work to be done in that line&mdash;and you&rsquo;re
      husky and can scare &rsquo;em, providing Big Mike hasn&rsquo;t already scared
      &rsquo;em enough. There isn&rsquo;t a thing in the show but what&rsquo;s a fake&mdash;of
      course you understand that. Most of &rsquo;em are too ashamed to squeal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was leading me into the inner mysteries of the place while he talked.
      He made no reference to the objects which were ranged around the sides of
      the big room, plainly despising them as curiosities which could not
      possibly interest anybody. But they interested me mightily and I lagged
      behind to give each one a glance in passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Siamese Susie&rdquo; was made up of a couple of big wax dolls confined in a
      single dress. &ldquo;The Peruvian Cockatoo&rdquo; manifestly had been, when he was
      alive, the humble master of some up-country barn-yard; now he was tricked
      out with all sorts of dyed false feathers, including an enormous topknot.
      The &ldquo;Mormon Giant&rdquo; was a papier-mâché figure, and there was a hideous
      thing labeled &ldquo;Mermaid&rdquo; constructed of the same material as the giant.
      There were a few other nondescript exhibits in dingy glass cases or
      mounted on stands draped in dirty hangings. I had never seen a collection
      of more shameless frauds. I began to understand that I had not been let in
      on the main proposition for money-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one side of the room there were curtains lettered: &ldquo;Professor Jewelle,
      the World&rsquo;s Greatest Seer.&rdquo; The professor came out when Dawlin called for
      him. He wore a wig and false white whiskers, and had watery eyes, and a
      breath like a whiff from a distillery chimney. A big brute of a man was
      loafing in one corner of the room, and I reckoned that this person must be
      Big Mike; I had seen many such of the bouncer sort when I had made my
      rounds, hunting for experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dawlin introduced me, and I seemed to make a good impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he slyly slid out the information that I, too, had been having
      troubles which had kept me under cover for some weeks, I noted that I
      stood even higher in their estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we talked on I began to feel a bit ambitious. I thought I might be able
      to improve business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; I suggested, &ldquo;why not put a tank in here and let me do some
      of my diving stunts? It would be a novelty&mdash;there really doesn&rsquo;t seem
      to be much to the show as it stands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, I haven&rsquo;t pulled a greenhorn into camp, have I?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Dawlin
      with a good deal of tartness. &ldquo;Show? Good gad! who ever said we wanted a
      show?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not know what to say to that and so I did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think I would be doing, or the &lsquo;prof&rsquo; would be doing, while
      the jethros were crowded around you? We wouldn&rsquo;t be doing a thing in the
      line of the regular graft. The main idea of this concern is to get &rsquo;em
      in here where there&rsquo;s nothing to take up their minds after they&rsquo;ve had one
      look around the place. Then they begin to feel that they want to get
      something for their money. So the &lsquo;prof&rsquo; hands &rsquo;em the dome dope&mdash;feels
      their bumps&mdash;and I feed &rsquo;em the gazara stuff. How many times
      have I got to tell you what this place is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m wise,&rdquo; I said, trying hard to look that way. &ldquo;But of course I&rsquo;m
      anxious to do all I can to help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The zeal of youth! The zeal of youth!&rdquo; prattled the professor. He seemed
      to me to be pretty much of an old fool. He had that smug, cooing way with
      him&mdash;all put on like the airs of a country undertaker. He came across
      to me before I could understand what he was about and stuck his thumb onto
      a spot on the top of my head and pressed with his forefinger a little
      lower down. &ldquo;Yes, approbativeness well developed and conscientiousness&mdash;this
      where my finger&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shut up!&rdquo; snorted Mr. Dawlin. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry to put that stuff over among
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; the professor went on, continuing to fondle my head, &ldquo;the
      development of the brain upward, forward, and backward, from the medulla&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save it for the cud-wallopers, I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this young man is going to have his say about me in front, I want him
      to know that the science of phrenology has a good exponent here,&rdquo; said the
      professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reckon he had seen me looking him over without a great amount of liking
      and was anxious to put on a bit of a front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll say that you&rsquo;ll read all heads free of charge, and that&rsquo;s <i>all</i>
      he&rsquo;ll say,&rdquo; stated Mr. Dawlin. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t necessary for him to know the
      difference between a medulla and a free-lunch pickle&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t
      believe <i>you</i> know, yourself. Ross, we want to open the doors again
      to-morrow. Do you think you can get the gist of that patter into your head
      overnight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thumbed the dirty sheets and said I&rsquo;d do my best. Therefore, I went to
      my room and applied myself. There was a lot of extravagant guff about the
      curiosities, flowery flapdoodle of the usual barker sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning I was able to make some sort of a try at it from the
      stand, for I have said before that I always was more or less cheeky. A
      sort of a fluffy-ruffle damsel with bleached hair was in the ticket-office
      and there never was a young fellow yet who did not try on a little extra
      swagger when a girl was hard by. She smiled at me encouragingly when I had
      arrested the attention of a few passers, some of whom bought tickets and
      went in. I guess I must have smiled back, for Dawlin, who was standing in
      the doorway, appraising my first efforts, came and climbed up beside me
      and growled in my ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re breaking in fine. Only put a little more punch and sing-song into
      it! And, by the way, the dame who is shuffling the pasteboards&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      private goods&mdash;mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want her,&rdquo; I said, with considerable heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say you do&mdash;but a lot of trouble has sometimes been made in
      partnerships by women. So that&rsquo;s why I have flipped the buried card at the
      start-off. Now tune up and let it went! If your voice gets husky I&rsquo;ll send
      out a handful of bird-seed and a hunk of cuttlefish.&rdquo; I reckoned he was
      trying his cheap humor on me to smooth the insult about the girl. It
      seemed to me like an insult, and he understood pretty well how I felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I went to my job and minded my own business most exclusively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day after day, for several weeks, I stood up on my rostrum and cajoled
      folks into that joint, and I say frankly and honestly that for a long time
      I did not have full understanding of just what went on inside. Possibly
      that statement makes me out a mighty stupid chap.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was ashamed to ask any more questions after what Dawlin had yapped
      out about his suspicions that I was a greenhorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not have any special conversation with him, anyway. I was still ugly
      when I thought upon his warning about that painted girl&mdash;as if I
      wanted her! And I was careful that she should have no word to carry to him
      about me; I never looked in her direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, I did not want to know very much about what they were up to
      inside. I was ashamed of my job. It struck me that if I came to know all
      the fraud of the thing I&rsquo;d jack the proposition. An ostrich sort of
      attitude, to be sure, a foolish evasion, but that&rsquo;s just how it was, like
      other things which came up in my life, things not lending themselves
      readily to explanation as I look back on them now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw patrons come out, some angry and with red faces, some ashamed, some
      laughing&mdash;but only a few of the last, and they were plainly chaps who
      took it as a joke when anybody could put something across in their case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Man after man came out with a broad piece of paper in his hand, crumpled
      it up, swore, and dashed it down on the sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a chart purporting to be a reading of bumps, as Professor Jewelle
      sized up the patron&rsquo;s cranium. Nobody seemed to be very well pleased. A
      lot of them pitched into me and said that I had promised that the reading
      was free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the reading was free.
    </p>
    <p>
      But once the victim had ventured inside the curtains and after the free
      reading, the professor handed over the chart and demanded three dollars
      for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disputes ended promptly, for Big Mike was always present. The vocabulary
      of that bellowing bull was limited to two words in those séances&mdash;&ldquo;Three
      dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course I had to find this out before long or stand convicted in these
      records as liar and half-wit combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also found out about the gazara game, Mr. Dawlin&rsquo;s special project.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an oblong box in which were stacked leather envelopes, each
      envelope bearing a numbered card.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dawlin seemed to be a very generous individual; he would allow patrons
      to win considerable money by picking prize envelopes into which he had
      slipped crisp bills; he also seemed to be a careless operator. For
      instance, he would quite openly put a twenty or a fifty dollar bill into
      the envelope holding the card numbered 0. Then he would shuffle the
      envelopes and with carelessness utterly blind would leave the corner of
      that card sticking up a bit, revealing the upper part of the numeral.
      Feverishly excited patrons would bid high for the privilege of drawing
      first&mdash;sometimes almost as high as the prize itself, for Mr. Dawlin
      had plainly left a good thing exposed. But, strangely enough, what had
      seemed like the figure 0 was revealed in the drawing as the figure 9 with
      an exaggerated upper loop. If the patron made moan and let out the secret
      of his grief, Mr. Dawlin reproached him for trying to take advantage of an
      oversight in an honest game. Such was the activity known as &ldquo;gazara&rdquo; in
      our establishment! I don&rsquo;t know who gave the game that designation. I
      believe that in Maccabees a town of that name is spoken of&mdash;and being
      in Apocrypha seems well placed. It may be that the game started there&mdash;at
      the same time the gold-brick game was hatched in Gomorrah. Both schemes
      must be very ancient&mdash;for they are true, tried, and certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dawlin had much information to give me regarding games in general. He
      told me about his brother Ike, a proficient gold-brick artist. He said
      that if I cared to go into that line he would put me next to his brother.
      Mr. Dawlin, as had the others of his fraternity, complimented me on my
      honest looks. When I dared to suggest that the gold-brick scheme must be
      known to everybody, and all played out, he laughed at my ignorance. He
      said that getting a whole lot for a little always had been a bait for
      human greed and always would be; as to getting at the yaps in these days,
      it was only a matter of fresh style of approach and men like his brother
      were thinking up new methods of approach all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men who needed money in a hurry to make up a balance were almost always
      ready to gamble heavily and desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said his brother had a deal on at that very time, but that it was too
      late for me to get in on that, for the thing was all set and pretty near
      ready to be pulled off. It was an up-country case, of course.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Plant by &lsquo;Peacock&rsquo; Pratt,&rdquo; said Davdin. That was a new name for my roster
      of rascality, and I stuck it into a mental pigeonhole. &ldquo;Pratt is a
      white-vest operator. Paunch scenery!&rdquo; He saw that I wasn&rsquo;t catching him
      very well and explained that Pratt affected the manner of a prosperous
      Westerner who regularly stoned neighbors&rsquo; chickens out of his garden with
      gold nuggets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of gold, I was not specially dissatisfied with the rake-off I was
      getting from these precious rascals, though, of course, it was small as
      compared with my diver&rsquo;s wages. But standing in the sunshine under a
      plug-hat with nothing to do but gabble nonsense was a softer snap than
      grubbing under muddy water with a diver&rsquo;s helmet stuck over my head. I was
      truly in a way to succumb to the blandishments of my cheap screak and
      settle down into the practice of roguery.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I had some sense of shame left in me. I kept on that disguising
      mustache when I was before the public. It was not much of a mask, to be
      sure, but it comforted me a bit to know that it made me look unlike
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that&rsquo;s why the Sortwell boys from Levant did not recognize me when
      they halted on the sidewalk one day and listened to my barking.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they were, the two of them, grown up to manhood; but they were
      mighty green specimens. They were looking at the banners rather than at
      me. I wagered with myself that it was the first time they had ever been in
      the big city; even one trip would have rounded off some of the rough
      comers they were showing. For instance, they surely would have had
      experience with such a peep-show as we were running and would not have
      been tempted.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked over to the painted maiden and asked her if she could
      recommend the show; they grinned and gaped at her amorously. She fawned on
      them and they bought tickets and went in. I wasn&rsquo;t a bit sorry, nor did I
      try to stop them. My last expenence with the gang in Levant had not
      implanted in me any hankering to hug and kiss the Sortwell boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      I watched for them to come out, for I felt pretty sure that they would be
      properly trimmed and I anticipated secret relish in looking on their
      faces. I told myself I didn&rsquo;t care. If a good jolt should be handed to
      them it would help in satisfying my grudge against the town which had sent
      me flying. Bitterness was in me at that moment. I was glad I was out of
      the jay place. If I had stayed there I would be looking just like those
      simpering rubes who had gone in like lambs to be sheared. I&rsquo;d never want
      to go back to that town, I decided all over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they came out each one carried one of Professor Jewelle&rsquo;s charts, and
      they were crying like great calves&mdash;actually guffling slobbering
      sobs. They went away a little distance and stood on the sidewalk, looking
      at each other and scruffing tears from their eyes with the palms of their
      hands. Awhile back if somebody had told me I would see a couple of big,
      larruping chaps from Levant doing that on the street in broad daylight,
      I&rsquo;d have predicted a good laugh for myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, there was nothing like that in my case!
    </p>
    <p>
      A lump swelled in my throat. I don&rsquo;t know what it was&mdash;whether &rsquo;twas
      homesickness, longing for my own people of my own kind, spectacle of boys
      who had gone barefoot with me, sight of their sorrow, mindfulness of what
      the cruel city had done to me, reflection that I had helped in a measure
      to get them into their scrape&mdash;I say I don&rsquo;t know just what it was.
      But my throat gripped and tears flowed up into my eyes. Those poor devils,
      who were children in spite of their size, were helplessly adrift&mdash;I
      could see that. Something special must have happened to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I seem to be stopping to analyze my emotions. At the time I was doing
      nothing of the sort. I felt a comforting sense that I was not a rascal
      down in my heart, in spite of what I had done and of the job I was holding
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left my rostrum, ran into the little office, and tipped Dawlin&rsquo;s bottle
      of whisky against my upper lip; the alcohol dissolved the gum and I ripped
      off the mustache. Then I chased along after the Sortwell boys. They were
      far up the street, plugging slowly with bowed shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came close upon them I took my time to get my breath and control my
      emotions. Then I called to them, and they turned around and stared at me
      with eyes which expressed all the range of feelings between interrogation
      and stupefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, haven&rsquo;t you anything to say to an old friend?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; faltered the older. &ldquo;It may look like you, but it ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t anything in this place that&rsquo;s looking like it really is,&rdquo;
       whimpered the younger. &ldquo;There was a card with a zero on it and it wasn&rsquo;t a
      zero&mdash;it was a nine&mdash;and he took our money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you lost your money, boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of it&mdash;every scrimptom of it,&rdquo; bawled the older. &ldquo;We &rsquo;ain&rsquo;t
      got anything to get home with. We saved up to come down and see the city
      for a couple of days&mdash;and now it&rsquo;s all gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We worked all winter logging&mdash;sweating and freezing in Cale Warson&rsquo;s
      swamp&mdash;to earn that money, and that hell-hound down there took it and
      jammed it into his pants pocket. And how&rsquo;ll we get home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I knew what logging in a swamp was! I knew what sort of wages were
      paid and how hard it is to save! That one sentence fairly lanced my
      conscience. &ldquo;He jammed it into his pocket!&rdquo; To Jeff Dawlin, who reached
      out and took in his money so easily, those bills were hardly more than so
      much paper, as he handled them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had not been a boy in a country town where money is not come at so
      easily, where the little hoards grow so slowly, where there are so many
      dreams about the big world up in the attics under the patched coverlids&mdash;dreams
      which the little savings may bring to realization!
    </p>
    <p>
      These were boys from my home town. Thank God, a lot of the cheap in me,
      the soul-dirt I had rubbed off in my associations, the cynical notions
      about right and wrong, the inclinations of a swaggering sport&mdash;yes, a
      whole lot of that slime was washed out of me right there and then by my
      new emotions. I don&rsquo;t say I was made anyways clean&mdash;not all of it
      went. I have done many things since then to be ashamed of. But I was a
      blamed sight more of a man when I went up and patted those poor boys on
      their backs, standing between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take on about it any more, fellows,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll be able
      to do something for you.&rdquo; My tone was pretty important and they began to
      look me over; they had been so fussed up that they had not taken full
      stock of me till then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Golly! You&rsquo;re rich, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; gasped the older.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now about losing this money&mdash;where did you lose it?&rdquo; I asked,
      swelling a little more because I knew I was in the way to make a big
      impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down the street there&mdash;where those fraud duflickers are all billed
      out! It looked like a zero&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they charged three dollars apiece for feeling of our heads!&rdquo; put in
      the younger. &ldquo;There was a big man who cracked his fists&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind! I know all about all such places, boys. I won&rsquo;t allow any
      such things to be put across in this city on any friends of mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was talking as if I owned the town. They goggled at me as if they
      believed that I did own it. When I started back toward Dawlin&rsquo;s joint they
      followed me like hounds at heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I flipped a lordly gesture at the girl in the ticket-office and walked in
      without paying&mdash;herding my clients ahead of me. That was visible
      evidence of my mysterious importance, and they looked up at me as if they
      were ready to fall down and offer worship. For in America any man who can
      walk past ticket-sellers and pay by a flip of the hand, displays a power
      which autocrats may envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure this is the place?&rdquo; I asked the Sortwell boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      They breathlessly assured me that it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the man who made us pay him six dollars,&rdquo; declared the older.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Jewelle had stepped out through the slit in his curtains. I
      walked up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you charge these gentlemen six dollars&mdash;take the money from
      them?&rdquo; I asked, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw that there was something on and, like a rogue, believed, of course,
      that I was plotting further graft on these innocents. He played up to me
      with shrewd promptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have done anything wrong I ask pardon,&rdquo; he whined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are particular friends of mine. Hand over their money at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned his back on them while he pulled out the money and gave me a
      wink which indicated that he was on and approved whatever game I was
      playing. I kept my face straight and stern, for the boys were surveying me
      with adoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      I handed them the money and went across to Mr. Dawlin&rsquo;s booth, the hicks
      at my heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dawlin was by nature more suspicious of his fellow-man than was
      Professor Jewelle, and he evidently resented the fact that I had not
      tipped him off in advance. He regarded me with much sullenness when I
      commanded him to return the money he had taken from the gentlemen. His
      sour unwillingness, mingled with his uncertainty, really helped my game
      along. It looked as if I had the power to force even such a balky mule as
      Dawlin seemed to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about this!&rdquo; he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that! You&rsquo;ll have to take my word&mdash;till you can get
      something better,&rdquo; I added, and I put a little significance into my last
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Dawlin, being a rascal who thought he could sniff a plant, decided
      to grab in on a partner&rsquo;s game. &ldquo;Why, sure, boss,&rdquo; he cried, heartily, &ldquo;if
      that&rsquo;s the way you feel about it! Take any gents that&rsquo;s friends of yours
      and all you have to do is speak the word!&rdquo; He pulled out of his trousers
      pocket a big wad of crumpled bills. &ldquo;Do you know how much they spent
      backing their opinion against mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was twenty-two dollars&mdash;it was just twenty-two dollars,&rdquo; piped
      one of the boys, and the other one helped out on the chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rising young financiers seem to have no doubt,&rdquo; sneered Dawlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The older boy looked at the big swatch of bills and rasped his rough hands
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps money don&rsquo;t mean much to you, mister, handling it the way you do!
      But if you earnt twenty-two dollars by day&rsquo;s work, getting into a
      popple-swamp before sunup, I guess you&rsquo;d know it when you counted those
      dollars out to anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the way you earned this money? How much more did you earn?&rdquo;
       Dawlin screwed a look at me, showing fresh suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do the talking,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk because I know what I&rsquo;m doing! I
      say only this: hand over the coin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I say again, I don&rsquo;t know about that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I reckoned I was overplaying my air of importance, so I found a chance to
      slip him a wink which promised a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know who I am!&rdquo; I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then pay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to grin, finding this little comedy amusing as well as
      mysterious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing, boss! And seeing that it&rsquo;s you and your orders,&rsquo; here&rsquo;s five
      dollars for your friends on top of the twenty-two. Go and buy five
      dollars&rsquo; worth of corned beef and eat your heads off! Nothing like going
      the limit when you come down to the big burg!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave Mr. Dawlin a knowing look when I turned to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends are much obliged for the extra five&mdash;but they can use it
      for something else besides eats. Come on, gentlemen! You will be my guests
      at dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could see by Dawlin&rsquo;s face that he took that last as a straight tip from
      me that I had designs on the countrymen&mdash;and that he would understand
      why I was quitting my job for a time. He gave me a most benignant smile
      when I left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Jewelle smirked and bowed when we passed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Mike, the ogre of the place, stepped politely to one side and twisted
      his ugly mug into a one-sided grin of apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we went out in state.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a new feeling in me. It was a longing to be with those boys from
      home. Up to then I had been ashamed to meet anybody from Levant. And out
      of that shame had come a sort of dread to hear any news from my old town.
      Now I was hungry for news.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, just at that moment I was in a fool&rsquo;s paradise of spurious
      importance. It was comforting, however, to be set on a pedestal by those
      Sortwell boys, and to know that at least two persons from Levant had
      stopped thinking of me as a runaway scalawag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with my new feelings had come a sort of vague hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked out of Dawlin&rsquo;s place with a hazy notion that I would never go
      back. Dawlin was evened up with me as to finances&mdash;I had my last
      week&rsquo;s rake-off in my pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I may say right here that I never did go back&mdash;not to stand up
      and coax suckers! When I did go back I played Mr. Jeff Dawlin for one!

    <h2>
      IX&mdash;A GRISLY GAME OF BOWLS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> DID not bother
      with any of the victualing houses in that low-down locality. I led the
      Sortwell boys uptown and ushered them into a very fancy restaurant. I
      could see that their opinion of my greatness was growing all of the time.
      I could not induce them to touch the bill of fare or even look at it. They
      gaped in such a frightened way when I mentioned fancy dishes, that I
      helped to set them at ease by ordering steak and potatoes. They ate to the
      last scrap, cleaning their plates with morsels of bread, even as grateful
      pups lick their platters. They confessed that they had not dared to go
      into an eating-house, and I remembered that first day when I had roamed
      the streets of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to ask questions about Levant, but I delayed. Dave Sortwell, the
      older, opened up the subject, but he did not do it very gracefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon they can&rsquo;t slur the Sidneys after this, like they have always
      done past back,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here you are, something big down here in the
      city&mdash;and your uncle Deck is first selectman of Levant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So my uncle had achieved his political ambition! When I heard that news I
      had inside me a feeling of apprehension which I could scarcely account
      for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elected last week at the March town-meeting,&rdquo; affirmed Ardon, the
      brother. &ldquo;We younger fellows that have come of voting age went for him&mdash;most
      all of us, because he say&rsquo;s he is going to turn politics in our town
      upside down and dance a jig on the bottom of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was into the tavern the other night, pretty well teaed up,&rdquo; giggled
      Dave, &ldquo;and he said he was going to gallop Judge Kingsley to hell and stand
      over him with a red-hot gad while he shoveled brimstone. He has got it in
      for the judge&mdash;and a good many folks in Levant ain&rsquo;t sorry. Judge
      Kingsley has always gouged folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they put the judge out of the treasurership&mdash;did my uncle bring
      that about?&rdquo; Hearing that the feud was on worse than ever made my heart
      sick. I had been hoping!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord, no! I guess the judge is forever fixed in that job. Folks can&rsquo;t
      seem to think of anybody else as treasurer. He&rsquo;s a financier,&rdquo; said Dave,
      reverently. &ldquo;He knows all about handling money. Folks trust to him for
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you say my uncle&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your uncle is doing most of the saying. Folks stand round and listen. I
      don&rsquo;t know what he is trying to do to the judge. Nobody seems to know.
      Guess he can&rsquo;t do much of anything except talk. You know, yourself, Ross,
      how he keeps sparked up most of the time. Maybe he don&rsquo;t know just what he
      says, himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I began to skirt the edges of conditions in Levant, asking questions about
      this one and that, showing as much indifference as I could. But the
      Sortwell boys showed even more indifference about their home town. It was
      all too familiar to them. They were displaying increasing interest in me,
      and were emboldened to ask questions, now that their early awe was wearing
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found out&mdash;and I was rather surprised&mdash;that the folks in
      Levant had not heard a word about me since I left the town. I had rather
      expected that Dodovah Vose would drop some hint as to what had become of
      me&mdash;and yet, on reflection, I could see that prudence required him to
      keep still. He had helped a prisoner to escape, and could not well let
      anybody suspect that he knew the whereabouts of that prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, boys,&rdquo; I said, when they had flanked me with questions
      from every approach and had finally and fairly pounced on me to find out
      what I was doing for a living and how I was so important, &ldquo;I am hitched up
      with big business interests who don&rsquo;t allow their men to talk. I&rsquo;d tell
      you if I could tell anybody. It isn&rsquo;t one special kind of business&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      all kinds&mdash;a sort of a syndicate&mdash;a combination. You
      understand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They hastened to say that they did&mdash;and I was glad of that because I
      didn&rsquo;t understand, myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll let us say that you&rsquo;re in this big business, won&rsquo;t you? When
      we get back home we want to tell all of &rsquo;em that they&rsquo;d better not
      slur you any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose the backbiters have been busy, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not much nowadays except somebody remarks once in a while that you
      had to skip the town. You know how such things pop up in talk. Your uncle
      being prominent nowadays, you get mentioned once in a while. But Dodovah
      Vose has always stood up for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a lot of folks didn&rsquo;t believe what that detective said. He wasn&rsquo;t a
      real detective, anyway. He was only a deputy sheriff from Pownal,&rdquo; added
      Ardon, and the next minute I felt like hugging the boy. &ldquo;I was always
      ashamed of how us fellows put you in bad, Ross, and so I owned up when
      Celene Kingsley asked me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I couldn&rsquo;t help it! I came right up in my chair. &ldquo;Celene Kingsley asked
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He misunderstood my heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mad, Ross! I stood up for you, I say! I was sorry for what I
      did. I was ashamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said Celene Kingsley asked you something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t remember whether she came right to me and asked me or
      whether it just happened that the thing came up somewhere or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would surely remember if <i>she</i> came to you!&rdquo; I could not
      conceive of Celene coming to anybody without it marking a mile-stone in
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the Sortwell boy had plainly decided to be non-committal until he
      had a better line on my feelings in the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to be mad because I talked it over, Ross. I stood up for
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But did she come <i>asking?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We-e-ll, I guess she must have asked&mdash;or&mdash;or something! Anyway,
      it came up in talk&mdash;somehow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Confound his haziness!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of course I stood up for you. It was only right! I told her how you
      tried to bust up the Skokums! I said you threatened to bat out the brains
      of the whole of us if we didn&rsquo;t stop cutting-up. I told her that they
      hadn&rsquo;t ought to have arrested you that night, for you was trying to stop
      us from raiding her father&rsquo;s house to grab that detective. You said
      something about a home being a castle&mdash;or&mdash;or something. Anyway,
      Ross, I did the best I knew how&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t so much good in talk as you
      are. Honestly, I did the best I could to put you straight when she asked.
      Yes, I reckon she did ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was looking at him with such rapturous expression that his face cleared
      of uncertainty regarding my feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, she must have asked, for I wouldn&rsquo;t go to blart-ing that around,
      making the rest of us out as pirates, unless she had pinned me down. I
      reckon she did just that! Pinned me down. But I was glad to help you out
      that much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It came to me with a rush of sentiment that all I had done that day for
      the Sortwell boys had been fully paid for long in advance, and I was sorry
      because a whole lot of my actions had really been dictated by my
      selfishness and my desire to show off.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reached across the table and took his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ardon, I&rsquo;m going to own up that I have had a lot of bitter thoughts about
      the folks in Levant since I left home. But if I had known that I had only
      one friend there like you have been in this matter, I would have put all
      the bad things out of my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only told the truth, Ross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s the hardest job a man undertakes to do in a lot of cases.&rdquo; I
      was thinking just then how hard <i>I</i> would find it to own up about
      myself, and how I had secured that money from the clutches of the rogues
      in Dawlin&rsquo;s joint. And there I was, making a lot of capital out of that
      deceit!
    </p>
    <p>
      But after what I had just heard I was resolved to go ahead and make more
      capital out of my pretensions to greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to let us say that you have made good, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked
      Dave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get back into the good opinion of the old town, boys. If you
      feel like saying something nice about me when you get back to Levant, I&rsquo;ll
      be grateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, if we don&rsquo;t blow your horn!&rdquo; they cried in concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not too loud, boys! I don&rsquo;t want to have too big a reputation to live
      up to when I come back home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood up and clapped me on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gorry! you will come, won&rsquo;t you, and show &rsquo;em?&rdquo; pleaded Dave.
      &ldquo;Come and show &rsquo;em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing to be thought of first,&rdquo; I said, with a grin. &ldquo;Has
      my uncle Deck stopped threatening to kill me on sight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That stirred their memories and fetched a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t dare to give you as much as one yip if you walked up to him
      looking like you do now,&rdquo; said Dave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought which he suggested was comforting; so much in this world does
      depend on outside appearances. The hankering in me to go back was whetted;
      just to make a show in the face and eyes of Levant, to stop their tongues
      for good and all! But I was conscious that deep under those cheaper
      motives was something more compelling. I had felt the thrust of it after
      Ardon Sortwell had told me of his confession to Celene. She, at least,
      knew that I had not been a renegade, and she had taken enough interest in
      me to make sure on that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you coming back, Ross?&rdquo; demanded Dave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell anybody I am coming back, boys. Promise me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you may say that you saw me in the city, and that I am doing well,
      and sent my best regards to all my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make their cussed old ears sing,&rdquo; declared Ardon. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry
      about us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can arrange my business so as to leave it, I may run up later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I showed them some of the city sights that afternoon and they started for
      home that night&mdash;and I saw to it that they were safely aboard their
      train.
    </p>
    <p>
      That I should dream of Levant that night was entirely natural. They were
      enticing dreams and they made me homesick and I found out that I was not
      such a bold man, after all, in spite of the shell I had grown; I felt very
      much like a boy when I woke next morning. I was hungry for my own folks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my haste to be gone I forgot all my caution. I went down to the
      water-front just as if there were no such person as a vengeful Anson C.
      Doughty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had cached, temporarily, my diving equipment. I went to the storage-man
      and arranged for its care, paying in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I was bold enough to go hunting up Jodrey Vose because I wanted to
      carry some fresh and direct message to his brother in order to secure
      continued favor in the case of the tavern-keeper; he certainly had been my
      best friend in Levant. I intended to lodge with him and I dreaded his keen
      questioning in case I went to him with lies about when I had seen his
      brother last.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the captain on his lighter and we had a good talk during his
      rest-spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it has turned out for you as it has, young Sidney. But it&rsquo;s a
      good idea for you to run up to the old town and hang round with Dod for a
      while and sort of get your feet placed all over again. Maybe something
      will turn up down this way later!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anson C. Doughty&rsquo;s toes, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wagged his head, soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you came down to take leave, son, but you&rsquo;re running chances.
      Anson C. Doughty is mighty ugly. He was beaten up in front of his crew&mdash;and
      folks haven&rsquo;t got done talking and he knows they are talking. You&rsquo;d better
      be hipering, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sent one of the helpers to his cabin for a parcel and he put it into my
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be handier than sending it by express to Dod,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
      skull I found in the dock. Tell him to make up a pirate yarn to go with
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being thus equipped with full credentials as to my continued comfortable
      standing with Jodrey Vose, for the purposes of my further intimacy with
      Dodovah Vose, I started up the wharf in excellent spirits, my thoughts on
      my home-going.
    </p>
    <p>
      And half-way to the street I fairly bumped into Anson C. Doughty. It was
      no coincidence&mdash;I ought to have reckoned on that meeting&mdash;the
      manager was regularly up and down the wharf at all hours of the day. But,
      as I have said, I had lost my caution. I had met him once face to face,
      and had not been recognized. But I was no longer wearing that mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swore a blue streak and danced back and forth in front of me, waving
      his hairy hands to shoo me back. He looked just as much like a cockroach
      as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You belong in State prison and you&rsquo;re going there,&rdquo; he snarled.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two wharf loafers near by, the only men in sight. He called to
      them, and they came to us, a couple of husky stevedores.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know <i>me!</i>&rdquo; shouted Doughty. &ldquo;You two men hold this sucker till
      I can fetch a cop. Hold him! Don&rsquo;t let him get away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran off toward the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not a chance to get away from those big chaps on that narrow wharf&mdash;and
      it was plain that they knew Anson C. Doughty and recognized his authority
      in those quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      So here were all my fresh plans, my hankering for home, my new-laid
      reputation for Levant consumption about to be kicked into the black depths
      of tophet by the grudge of Anson C. Doughty!
    </p>
    <p>
      I could see that the stevedores despised my size because I was wearing a
      plug-hat; they glowered at me with the natural enmity the man in overalls
      feels for the dandy. It was perfectly damnable&mdash;that situation! To be
      arrested&mdash;to be shown up for what I was&mdash;the thought screwed my
      desperation to the breaking-point.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pulled my wallet and began to flick out bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only trying to get back at me on account of a grudge, fellows; he&rsquo;s
      using you for tongs,&rdquo; I told them. &ldquo;I was one of the divers and I batted
      him when he insulted me! I want to get out of town! Here&rsquo;s a piece of
      money! He won&rsquo;t give you anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had the skull under my arm and my wallet in my hands, and I wasn&rsquo;t
      paying much attention to the men while I counted out money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was the gink who told us to hold the guy?&rdquo; muttered one of the men.
      &ldquo;Was it Doughty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! You know him,&rdquo; said his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he don&rsquo;t know <i>us!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t remember who you are!&rdquo; I hastened to put in. &ldquo;Take some money,
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet we&rsquo;ll take some money,&rdquo; barked the two of them in chorus, and the
      next instant one of them clutched me and the other grabbed wallet, money
      and all, and they ran away, ducked into an alley between storehouses, and
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was free at a high price.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran after them, of course, but they were nowhere in sight when I reached
      the parallel wharf, and so I started for the street; and Anson C. Doughty
      saw me, for he was running up and down the sidewalk, wildly hunting for a
      policeman. When he undertook to head me off I pitched the wrapped skull at
      him with all my might; it plunked him squarely in the face and dropped
      him, and then went bounding along the pavement at a lively clip. I was
      conscious that a lot of people were looking on and that a hullabaloo was
      started. But in spite of that I stopped to pick up the skull before I fled
      from the place. I reckon I must have felt considerable of a sense of
      responsibility where the interests of my friends, the Voses, were
      concerned!
    </p>
    <p>
      I got through a short street on the jump, caught a passing car and when I
      was once aboard I was lost to pursuers&mdash;I was merely one of the
      city&rsquo;s mass, and my garments testified for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dug down into my pockets and found a few crumpled bills and some silver&mdash;the
      loose money I carried outside my wallet. The whole of it amounted to
      mighty little&mdash;only about enough to take me to Levant, as I
      remembered what the train fare had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not stop to figure on any further resources; I did not dare to go
      and seek aid from any of my acquaintances; I did not go back to my room
      for any of my belongings. Panic was on me. To be caught at that time meant
      the toppling of my cardboard house of hopes and reputation. I did not know
      to what extent Anson C. Doughty would throw out his drag-net&mdash;but I
      was pretty sure that he would drop all his other business for a time and
      attend strictly to what concerned me. He surely was the angriest man I had
      seen in many a day when he went down under the impact of that package.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get out of that city just as quickly as I could, before he could set
      persons on my trail, or put spies at the city&rsquo;s outlets, was the only
      sensible course open to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in less than half an hour I found myself on the train, homeward bound,
      just as much of a fugitive <i>from</i> the city as I had been in other
      days when I headed <i>toward</i> it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a little spare change in my pocket and a skull under my arm.

      X&mdash;THE ART OF PUTTING ON A FRONT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>AVING caught a
      train out of the city at a fairly early hour in the forenoon, I made a
      daylight ride of it to Levant, and I stepped out upon the platform at
      Lower Comers just before sundown.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember that the red March sun was almost touching the rocky edge of
      the beech ridge, and, with the bare trunks of the trees striping it,
      looked like a coal fire with the stove cover off and a griddle on. In
      fact, as I looked up at the sun and reflected on the general condition of
      my affairs, I felt as if I were the particular live lobster destined for
      the griddle in Levant.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I walked past the platform loafers, leaving my satin-lined overcoat
      open so that they might get the full effect of my frock suit. No one
      seemed to recognize me; Levant Comers is all of three miles from Levant
      village, and there was never much mixing between the communities when I
      was a boy. I set off at a good pace to walk the three miles to Dodovah
      Vose&rsquo;s tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men in several teams which overtook me offered a lift, and one of them
      addressed me as &ldquo;Elder.&rdquo; Evidently my clothes were producing an
      impression! But I declined all offers. I had waved the stage-driver aside,
      and now if I accepted a free ride I might have brought suspicion on my
      financial ability. So I told them all politely that I needed exercise and
      walked on in all my dignity&mdash;and, being encumbered by nothing except
      a skull under my arm, I found my tramp pleasurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went along at such a clip that I topped the long rise from the river
      where the railroad winds and was able to look down on distant Levant
      village before the lingering dusk had settled into night. The stripped
      trees had left all the houses bare and rather bleak; there was no beauty
      anywhere. The afternoon chill had hardened the road mud into iron ridges.
      Being back on my native heath was not so consoling and heart-thrilling as
      I had pictured. That faded, sodden, frozen landscape was depressing. I
      looked like a millionaire, but I belonged on the town farm. There was one
      thing to remember, however. My uncle as first selectman was also overseer
      of the poor, by virtue of his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered what he would say to me if I walked up to him and tried to
      borrow money! On second thought, I knew so well what he would say that I
      promptly decided that I would keep my mouth shut in regard to my finances.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hurried on, for there was an inviting twinkle of light in the windows of
      Vose&rsquo;s tavern. I was carrying a rather gruesome ticket of admission, but a
      message from Jodrey Vose went along with it and it would make me
      especially welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some distance the highway was bordered by woods, and at last I saw a
      roadside sign which gave me a bit of a thrill, for it bore the magic name
      of Kingsley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Sale. This Wood-lot. Apply to Z. Kingsley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That&rsquo;s what the sign said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I was fairly on my way, after stopping to read, I was able to put
      eyes on Z. Kingsley, himself. He was in a carriage which was coming in my
      direction and his daughter was driving a horse which was too
      likely-looking to have been furnished by my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not reflect or consider. I had no clear notion in my mind at that
      instant. I suppose I was overcome by an irresistible hankering to hear her
      voice&mdash;to speak to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, backed by that longing or by courage or cheek or whatever
      else it might be called, I stepped out into the middle of the road and put
      up my hand. I reckon if Judge Kingsley had been driving he would have run
      over me. His blessed daughter pulled up short.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took off my hat and he gave me a sharp glance and recognized me. And so
      did Celene, for she smiled even while she looked a bit startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive on!&rdquo; snapped her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Kingsley, I want to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He checked me with much impatience, and I was glad of it, for I was not
      prepared to tell him just what I did want. I knew I wanted to rush up to
      her and say a lot of things, but I was conscious that the action would not
      have made much of a hit with her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no time to waste on you, sir. I have to catch a train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the train has gone along,&rdquo; I stalled. &ldquo;I just came in on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going the other way&mdash;to the city!&rdquo; He showed considerable
      temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have plenty of time before the down train is due, father,&rdquo; Celene told
      him. He reached after the reins, but she held them away from him, showing
      that she had more or less of the Kingsley obstinacy, herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want, sir? Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a rather contemptuous command, but it was showing more
      consideration for a member of the Sidney family than I had dared to hope
      for. If he had taken up the whip and lashed at me at first meeting I would
      not have been surprised. It was evident that my personal appearance was
      having weight with him. I ventured to believe that the Sortwell boys had
      been advertising me in town, though they were only a few hours ahead of
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rolled my eyes around, trying to think of something sensible. I saw the
      sign again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your price on this wood-lot, Judge Kingsley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop to talk business, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m simply asking the price. You&rsquo;re advertising it. You must have put
      a price on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a week or ten days. Come to me then. I&rsquo;m in a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I put on a fine air of importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I, Judge Kingsley! So are the big interests which I represent. But
      we are never in too much of a hurry to answer polite questions in
      business. I say, what is your price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two thousand dollars,&rdquo; he cracked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many acres?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I raised my hat and stepped to one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, sir. I&rsquo;ll investigate and be ready to talk with you when you
      return. Good evening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could see that he was taken aback a bit by my own shortness in the
      matter. He sat there holding his mouth open as if he intended to say
      something more, but I walked on; it came to me that perhaps he was going
      to say that he wouldn&rsquo;t do any business with a Sidney&mdash;and I was
      avoiding all argument on that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Celene gave me another flicker of a smile when she started the horse. They
      went on at a good clip, and the moment they were out of sight around a
      bend in the road I turned back, climbed the fence, and sat down beside
      some bushes. My heart was so warm within me that I was not afraid of a
      chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was guessing that she would not waste any time in making that trip to
      the railroad station; you see, I was building high merely on the glances
      she had been giving me&mdash;on the flush which was on her cheek when she
      drove away. Would she hurry back to overtake me? She did.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I saw her coming, snapping her whip to make the horse trot at a
      brisker pace, I climbed back over the pitch-pole fence and leaned against
      it. It was pretty dark, but she spied me and stopped the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done something rather foolish,&rdquo; I told her, staying where I stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have found out all over again that haste makes waste. I wanted to
      get a peep at that stand of timber and I went racing around in the dark&mdash;and
      so I have wrenched my ankle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so sorry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my own fault! It&rsquo;s what the city does to a man! Keeps him on the
      gallop! Makes him too impatient to wait for morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you get to the carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t like to trouble you, Miss Kingsley! If you will send a team&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you shall ride with me! The idea of my leaving you in the woods
      alone! I&rsquo;ll come and help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll manage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I limped to the carriage and climbed in. She watched me anxiously and
      asked after my hurt with solicitude. I was doing a pretty mean thing, I
      knew, but the opportunity to be alone with Celene Kingsley that first hour
      of my arrival in town was a favor to be grabbed for and hugged jealously.
      She walked the horse, and I sat beside her and was so happy in that first
      intimacy that I was not a bit ashamed of my deceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are doing wonderful things in the city!&rdquo; she said, after a time. I
      had not spoken, for I was afraid of blurting out something foolish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing so very grand,&rdquo; I faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Dave and Ardon Sortwell have had something to say about that since
      they have been home. I am very glad for you, Mr. Sidney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather please you than anybody else.&rdquo; That was a mighty awkward
      answer and I was just as much embarrassed as she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news about Levant boys pleases us all up here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I have thought they liked the bad news best&mdash;the most of
      &rsquo;em. The way they drove me out and then talked behind my back was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all the truth of it&mdash;and most of the folks do now, I think,&rdquo;
       she broke in. &ldquo;You must put it all out of your mind. You must not come
      back with resentment toward anybody. There&rsquo;s too much of that in the
      world. There&rsquo;s too much in Levant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated a moment and then burst out with a tremble in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Sidney, I am so thankful because you have come home! I do hope
      you can have some influence with your uncle. I ask your forgiveness for
      bringing it up so soon. But my heart is so full of it all! I hurried back,
      hoping I could overtake you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So that was why she had hurried!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about having influence with my uncle,&rdquo; I said, and I could
      not keep all of the rasp out of my voice. Her welcome of me simply as an
      uncle-tamer had pricked me in a mighty tender place. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he
      is going to give me either three cheers or a hug and kiss when he sees
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are an important man, now, and he must be proud of you and your
      success. He will look up to you now that you have money and position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like a bang on the head the conviction struck me that I had cut out a fine
      bit of work for myself when I dropped back into my home town.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been all too well advertised by my loving friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Celene Kingsley had touched squarely on one truth: the only way to handle
      my uncle was to appear important even if I were not important. Mere bluff
      would go a little way&mdash;but not far. I must have money!
    </p>
    <p>
      And here I was picked by her as her champion in the family feud!
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had only stayed in the city! There was money to be come at there.
      Dollars in Levant were nailed down with spikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t one happy hour in our home,&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;Your uncle is
      breaking my father&rsquo;s heart, Mr. Sidney. I don&rsquo;t understand what your uncle
      is doing; mother doesn&rsquo;t understand it! Father has never told his business
      to us. But he sits in his office and figures and figures. Sometimes he
      stays there &rsquo;most all night. And it&rsquo;s all on account of your uncle!
      I know that! For my father says your uncle is hounding him to death. You
      must find out what he is doing. I know you will find out and tell him he
      must stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will look into the matter,&rdquo; I said, as bravely as I could. &ldquo;Of course
      there&rsquo;s been hard feeling between my uncle and your father for a good many
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my father is sorry now for anything in the past. He says so to us, to
      mother and me. He sent mother to your uncle to ask him if he would not
      stop persecuting. Yes, she went to your uncle because father asked her to
      do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That statement nigh took my breath away!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Kingsley going as suppliant to my uncle Deck? Judge Zebulon Kingsley
      requesting her to do it? I shut my eyes and could picture her&mdash;frail,
      pale, aristocratic. The exigency must be desperate when Judge Kingsley
      would submit his wife to such employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But please keep that a secret,&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that I was headed into something which was bigger and more baleful
      than I had dreamed of. And more than before did I feel my deficiencies as
      a fraud who could not even turn a trick for his own wants, let alone those
      greater affairs in Levant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This mystery in our home is killing us all,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;There have
      been strangers in town and they have been much with my father. I do not
      like their looks. He would not tell us, but I am afraid they have coaxed
      him away to the city on this trip he is making. Perhaps your uncle has set
      those men on to harm him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had never gauged my uncle Deck as a hirer of assassins, but I had not
      seen him for some years, and I admitted to myself that there was never any
      telling where a man&rsquo;s grudge would lead him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother and I tried to make him stay at home. But he would not stay and he
      would not tell us why he was going to the city. Oh, how I hate those
      strangers, for I believe they have coaxed him away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked sideways at her, and a little shiver tingled in me. There was
      real venom in her tone and I saw that I had not guessed the depths in Miss
      Celene Kingsley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had a brother,&rdquo; she mourned. &ldquo;I believe he would feel as I feel
      now, and would follow up and kill the man who would harm my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was so strange an utterance from a girl and seemed so contrary to what
      I had supposed her nature to be that I remembered that outburst for a long
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I juggled the skull on my knee and pondered awhile before I said anything,
      and she was silent, too, evidently trying to get control of her emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to say this to you, Miss Kingsley. The Sort-well boys gave me some
      news of the home town and they told me that my uncle was after your father
      in bitter fashion. That&rsquo;s one reason why I have hurried up here. I don&rsquo;t
      know just what I can do with my uncle, but I&rsquo;ll truly do my best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had come into the edge of the village and had passed the first houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put my trust in you,&rdquo; she said, gently. &ldquo;I always knew you had good
      impulses in you. I remember our talk that day on Purgatory Hill. And I
      know you kept your promise you gave to me then. You did your best to make
      the boys good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll do my best to make my uncle good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope your business will not call you away until you have
      straightened matters out. Oh, you asked about the price of the wood-lot!
      Does it mean that you expect to have some business with father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not given another thought to the wood-lot since I had used it for an
      excuse in an emergency. I did not see at that moment how I could use a
      wood-lot for anything else than that excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only you could have some business with my father&mdash;it would smooth
      things so much for all of us, perhaps,&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what can be done,&rdquo; I assured her. &ldquo;This syndicate&mdash;this
      combination&mdash;a very large concern,&rdquo; I floundered on, trying to think
      up some sort of a plausible lie to account for my interest in a wood-lot,
      &ldquo;it&rsquo;s&mdash;er&mdash;ah!&mdash;you see, I can&rsquo;t give out much information
      locally because we do so many kinds of business&mdash;it&rsquo;s all linked up&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      necessary to move carefully, but I think I&rsquo;ll tell you this much,
      confidentially, just between ourselves!&rdquo; Again my hankering to have some
      sort of a secret between Celene Kingsley and myself! &ldquo;One branch of our
      business is building all the tall brick chimneys in the eastern part of
      the country. We use millions of bricks and so we need a great deal of wood
      for burning the bricks. So that&rsquo;s why, maybe, I can pay your father&rsquo;s
      price for the wood-lot. Now you understand!&rdquo; I ended up with a lot of
      relief, for I had to dive pretty deep for that lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do see, and I&rsquo;m glad there&rsquo;s a prospect you&rsquo;ll stay in town. And then,
      too, there&rsquo;s your ankle to nurse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was glad she mentioned the ankle, for I had forgotten all about it, and
      would certainly have betrayed myself when I jumped out of the carriage at
      the tavern. Really, to be a good liar a fellow should take one of those
      courses in memory-training! As it was, I descended carefully and promised
      her to apply cloths and liniment that night. She tendered her little hand,
      and I pressed it, and she left with me the memory of a smile which was
      like a rose gemmed with dew&mdash;-for there were tears in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited in the tavern yard till she was well on her way, and then I
      marched in without any limp, for I was not minded to keep up that special
      lie for the benefit of all Levant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dodovah Vose walked behind his catty-cornered counter, plucked a rusty pen
      from its potato scabbard, whirled the register around under my nose, and
      tendered the pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather nippy evenings, though pleasant enough daytimes for this time of
      year, Squire,&rdquo; he said, by way of welcome to the arriving guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      That tickled me. He didn&rsquo;t recognize me. He was looking at my rig rather
      than at my face. When I had splashed my name on the page he pulled his
      spectacles to the end of his nose and inspected the signature. Then he
      snapped upright and stared at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfrey domino Peter!&rdquo; he bawled. &ldquo;Then them Sortwell boys ain&rsquo;t such
      condemned liars as I suspected they were! When Jod wrote me that you had
      quit diving I reckoned you had gone plunk square to tophet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s always a chance for a fellow in the city, if he keeps
      hustling,&rdquo; I told him. I chinked the little handful of small change in my
      pocket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stay here with you for a spell, Mr. Vose. Have you a
      rule that guests without baggage must pay in advance?&rdquo; I grinned and he
      took it as a great joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can tell me enough about Jod I may adopt you and give you free
      board the rest of your life,&rdquo; he chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I handed over his present with a word of explanation, and he
      unwrapped the grisly object and surveyed it with as much satisfaction as
      if it had been a golden nugget.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jod always knows what will hit me to a T. Of course, he says to you,
      &lsquo;Tell Dod to make up a story to go with it&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly what he said, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! That&rsquo;s what I have done with every curio he has given me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time I realized that in my boyhood I had accumulated a fine
      line of fiction from Dodovah Vose.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I forgave him in my thoughts, for he took me into the big kitchen and
      fried me the finest chicken I ever ate. And while he fixed up my supper I
      told him how I had learned diving with his brother. I comforted him, too,
      by telling him that I had given up the work only temporarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I switched him when he tried to find out what I was up to at that
      time. The plug-hat part of my program seemed to puzzle him very much. I
      was not ready with any good explanation. I figured that I might have some
      kind of a story ready in the morning, after I had slept on the thing. I
      began to rely considerably on my work as a fabricator; I had shown quite a
      lot of aptitude and readiness on short notice, I reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found myself holding an impromptu reception in the tavern office that
      evening&mdash;and they were all there with their little gimlets of
      questions, boring for information, you can bet! Therefore I broke away
      early and went to bed. I staved them all off in good shape, for I could be
      dignified in those clothes I was wearing. What I was afraid of was that
      Uncle Deck would pop in. He would not have used any gimlet; he would have
      set upon me with a pod-auger of inquisition, and would have ridden on it
      so as to bear down hard! And I had not my story ready!

    <h2>
      XI&mdash;THE FAILURE OF AN UNCLE-TAMER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>URTHERMORE, in the
      morning I was just as much at sea. I had gone to sleep as suddenly as if
      somebody had hit me a tunk on the head; too much fried chicken and hashed
      brown potato! I did not wake up till Dodo-vah Vose marched through the
      tavern halls, playing the long roll on his gong. The March sun, level with
      the eastern windows, quivered with glorious light when I opened my eyes on
      it. I had all sorts of reasons to be downcast, but I was not when I waked
      and saw that sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scattered coins, my whole capital, lay on the carpet of braided rags,
      where they had slipped from my trousers pocket the night before when I
      hung the garment over a chair. I gazed over the billowing edge of the
      feather tick in which I was nested, and counted, for the sun lighted the
      floor and glinted on the coins. One dollar and thirty-seven cents!
    </p>
    <p>
      However, in spite of that spectacle, I hopped out of bed and dressed,
      whistling snatches of tupes furnished by music-hall memories. I was home
      again, Celene Kingsley had given me glances which my hopes translated into
      all sorts of dear promises&mdash;she had asked me to help her; the sun was
      shining, breakfast was ready! I went down-stairs whistling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Head up and tail over the dasher, hey?&rdquo; was the greeting from Landlord
      Vose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great world to live in,&rdquo; I told him. After I had tucked away a
      slice of home-smoked fried ham only a little smaller than a door-mat,
      along with eggs and the fixings, I felt even more resolute about fronting
      what was coming to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My spirit of boldness was even a bit hysterical, I guess. I rubbed the nap
      of my plug-hat smooth with my forearm, pulled on my overcoat, and went out
      and stood on the tavern porch, inhaling the tingling air of the morning,
      exhibiting myself to Levant like a gladiator stepping into the arena,
      announcing by pose and expression: &ldquo;Here I am. Now come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the first to answer my challenge was my uncle Deck. I think he had
      been waiting for me to appear. He walked across the village square, coming
      from the town office, and I hailed him from afar with a flourish of the
      hand and a &ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten feet away he stopped and looked me over. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come home
      last night, where you belong, instead of putting up at the tavern and
      letting me hear about it by word of mouth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Uncle Deck,&rdquo; I drawled, &ldquo;you remember&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he yapped, &ldquo;as I stand here I don&rsquo;t know whether to cuff your
      young chops or shake your hand. A good deal depends on you. If you go to
      digging up past foolishness I&rsquo;ll cuff you. As it is&rdquo;&mdash;he stepped
      forward, hand outstretched&mdash;&ldquo;as it is, son, I&rsquo;m glad to see you back,
      and I hear that you have made something of yourself. I&rsquo;m glad of that,
      too! Now get your volucus, or whatever your baggage is, and come to the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, Uncle Deck,&rdquo; I explained, dropping his hand after a hearty
      shake; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here on business this trip, not to go visiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference does that make about coming to my house, where you
      belong?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had me there&mdash;backed into a corner! He had his pod-auger out,
      ready to use on me, just as I had apprehended&mdash;and so help me! I was
      not ready with a story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dignified reserve and a plug-hat would not serve to trig my uncle Deck!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was necessary for me to dedare then and there what my business in
      Levant was. I had been clutching wildly into a lot of nebulous thoughts
      ever since waking, trying to get hold of something solid.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I found out then, as I had experienced before, and discovered on many
      occasions later, that there was in me something which enabled me to leap
      an emergency barrier when the goad was sharp enough and the danger near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to have dealings with a lot of men and I&rsquo;d be a nuisance around
      your premises, Uncle Deck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What dealings? No secret, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not! I&rsquo;m buying for a big syndicate. Buying standing timber.&rdquo; I
      said that because I had already committed myself with Celene Kingsley and
      it came to me that I&rsquo;d better have one story and stick to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! Buy some of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as I remember it, it&rsquo;s mostly black growth&mdash;pine and spruce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and cedar, fir, and hemlock! What in thunder does anybody want of
      any other kind of timber?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t use it. I&rsquo;m buying for a special purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt like a man trying to get across a brook without wetting his feet.
      Every time I leaped I was mighty glad and rather surprised to find another
      stepping-stone to land on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must be looking for hardwood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burn bricks for our factory chimneys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not look more than half convinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go into details even with you, Uncle Deck,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      ordered to buy close, and when names of big concerns are given out the
      sellers always raise prices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one big stand of hardwood in this town,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
      see you in damnation before I&rsquo;ll let you buy that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The red patches beside his nose began to flame. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come back at <i>me</i>
      with your &lsquo;whys&rsquo;! I&rsquo;ll tell you why you can&rsquo;t buy! It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ll be
      handing over money to that&rdquo;&mdash;(I never heard coarser oaths; my uncle
      fairly choked on them)&mdash;&ldquo;to Zebulon Kingsley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the lot belongs to Judge Kingsley. I saw the sign on the fence and
      I happened to meet the judge right there and had some talk with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that you have been dickering with that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I broke in on his list of names. &ldquo;My concern has ordered me to buy
      hardwood and I&rsquo;m buying. I have no quarrel with Judge Kingsley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Great Jedux, you <i>have!</i> Don&rsquo;t you dare to tell me you have
      forgotten! You <i>have</i> got a quarrel with him. D&mdash;&mdash;n you,
      look out that you don&rsquo;t start one with <i>me!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come in here to mind my own business&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Condemn your ha&rsquo;slet!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;No wonder you didn&rsquo;t dare to come to my
      house last night! No wonder you&rsquo;re fighting shy of me to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his anger, I felt a sudden sense of relief. I did not need to
      waste effort and time on minor falsehoods, trying to explain why I did not
      come to his house; I could devote all my attention to my main lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fighting shy of you, Uncle Deck. I&rsquo;m a business man, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned sideways to me and switched his arm furiously, as if he held a
      goad and was trying to start a balky steer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come along over to my office,&rdquo; he commanded with a grate in his
      tones. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a matter to blart about on a street corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I followed him. He locked the door behind us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that I have been elected first selectman of this town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Uncle Deck. I&rsquo;m glad the citizens&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yah, for the citizens! First and last, it has cost me five thousand
      dollars to get this office. And it&rsquo;s for their own good I worked to get it&mdash;and
      they thought it was only to satisfy my grudge. That&rsquo;s all the credit a man
      gets from the fools who vote. But I&rsquo;m in this office now&mdash;I&rsquo;m headed
      straight for my mark&mdash;and the man who gets in my way will be bored
      like a cheese target! Do you hear that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They know enough in this town to keep out of my way! I have trained &rsquo;em.
      You don&rsquo;t dare to come back here, do you&mdash;my own nephew&mdash;and get
      in my way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only attending to my business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning by that you&rsquo;re thinking of buying a wood-lot from Zebulon
      Kingsley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Secretly I was sort of laughing at myself. Here I was, inviting a lot of
      trouble by insisting on doing something which was a positive
      impossibility, so it seemed then as I jingled my coins in my pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my business the same as you have yours, sir. I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did know!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;And if you are such a renegade as to forget
      what has been done to your family by that skunk, you know <i>now</i>&mdash;for
      I&rsquo;m telling you! You can&rsquo;t do business with Zebulon Kingsley. I say it!&rdquo;
       He pounded his fist on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept still. I was trying to work out in my mind some sensible idea as to
      what I really did intend to do in the matter of that wood-lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle leaned toward me over the table in the town office, propping
      himself on one fist and pounding softly and slowly with the other. His
      lips were rolled back and he growled his words deep down in his throat,
      almost in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what he is, now. I&rsquo;ve got the stuff on him. I&rsquo;ve had to work slow.
      I&rsquo;ve had to convince two devilish steers on the board of selectmen without
      telling &rsquo;em what I&rsquo;m after. But I&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em. And he is
      headed for hell and I&rsquo;m after him. And he knows it now and that&rsquo;s the best
      of it! Because I&rsquo;m taking my time while he is thinking it over! Oh, my
      gad! if only your father could have lived till now to see how the devilish
      old gouger and robber is getting his! And he is paying for your mother&rsquo;s
      tears and sweat with drops of his blood. And he is paying me, too. I stay
      up nights to see that lamp in his office window. And you say, do you, that
      you have come here to hand over money to Zebulon Kingsley? To the man who
      filed your father&rsquo;s heart in two with a mortgage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only in the way of ordinary trade,&rdquo; I ventured. I was wondering why
      I was continuing to provoke my uncle. But I knew I needed to start
      considerable of a smoke to screen my real condition from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is to be no trade between you,&rdquo; raged my uncle. &ldquo;No money from you
      shall touch that scoundrel&rsquo;s hands!&rdquo; Just at that moment I was more sure
      of that than he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle gave me a little opportunity to do some thinking, for he went to
      the office safe and pulled out a bottle and drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered what kind of a hold he had on Judge Kingsley. My curiosity was
      aflame. It was not believable that he could ruin the judge financially,
      for the Kingsleys had possessed wealth for many generations. Celene
      Kingsley, as the petted daughter of our village aristocrat, was too far
      above me for any hopes to bear fruit, even though they budded. But what
      would the Kingsleys be after my uncle had worked out his revenge, of whose
      success he seemed to be so sure?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know there has been trouble between the families, Uncle Deck,&rdquo; I said.
      &ldquo;I know we were not used right in money matters. But what is it you&rsquo;re
      going to do to Judge Kingsley? What is your grip on him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wiped his mouth with the palm of his hand and set back the bottle.
      &ldquo;None of your d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to go into anything blindfolded. I have business to
      consider, and I&rsquo;ll have to make explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get off better by making &rsquo;em to the men who have hired you
      than by explaining to me, if you don&rsquo;t do what I tell you to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m no kid any longer. I&rsquo;m running my own affairs, sir. If you can&rsquo;t
      let me in on the plans of this thing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He advanced on me, waggling his fist. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a devil of a fellow to come
      and pump me for secrets, you are! What do you want to do&mdash;run to him
      again like you did in the case of that hoss trade? Do you think I have
      forgotten that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, and I know you never will, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I say now, ask no questions and do as I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I edged toward the door, for I was pretty well mixed up in my own thoughts
      and did not care to get into any more of a row with my uncle&mdash;and all
      needlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you giving me your word?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not promising anything until I can think it over and decide on what&rsquo;s
      best to be done, Uncle Deck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll decide now before you leave this office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started toward me, but the key was in the door, and I turned it and
      stood ready to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come back here to fight me, have you? A Sidney fighting his own
      and nearest blood kin, eh?&rdquo; He came close and made threatening gestures. I
      put my arm across his breast and slowly pushed him back; I gave him good
      opportunity to note that the arm was a sizable one and mighty hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You plug-hatted dude!&rdquo; he frothed. &ldquo;Forgetting the duty you owe to your
      own because you have had a whirl in the city!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no dude, Uncle Deck, and calling me names and treating me like a
      brat, as you used to do, isn&rsquo;t going to get you anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not standing with your own family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can be loyal to my family, but I&rsquo;m not going to-shut my eyes and jump
      into a row just because you tell me it&rsquo;s your row.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw that I had produced an impression and he calmed down a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may be a good deal you can do to help me in the thing,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;But, blast it! after what you once did to me, I ain&rsquo;t sure I can trust
      you!&rdquo; He squinted his eyes and sized me up shrewdly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Sidney, and
      the old rat did dirt to you before you left this town. If you ain&rsquo;t
      willing to rise up now and swoop on him, there&rsquo;s a reason. You ain&rsquo;t stuck
      on that girl of his, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood surged into my face. I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I was thinking hard
      about her all through that talk. That was the last thing I would have
      looked for from my uncle. He had jumped me in fine shape, and he saw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yah-h-h!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;You fool! You devilish fool! It had to be a girl
      to keep you from doing your plain duty&mdash;and I knew it. Nothing but a
      girl would be putting a twist-bit into your mouth right now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong! You&rsquo;re all wrong!&rdquo; I protested, but I didn&rsquo;t sound real
      convincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did he, either, when he started to give me hints about her. His eyes
      shifted and he stammered. I took him by the arm with a good, hearty clutch
      and he shut up.
    </p>
    <p>
      There did not seem to be anything more to say just then, on the part of
      either of us; plainly, we had squared off at each other!
    </p>
    <p>
      So I walked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was glad because my first session with my uncle was over. But while I
      felt relief I knew I had pretty well done for myself where he was
      concerned. Of course, I had not intended to confess to him my financial
      condition, but deep down I had felt until then that if worse came to the
      worst he would see me out of a hole. He would have done something, at
      least, for my father&rsquo;s sake. But I had been the one to deal family loyalty
      the first kick. Now my uncle would see me starve and enjoy my sufferings;
      his grudges followed just such grooves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever else was ahead, it was pretty much up to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      I went back to the tavern, for it was some comfort just to look on Dodovah
      Vose&rsquo;s kindly face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see! You&rsquo;ve been dropping a word or two about doing business here,&rdquo;
       he prodded in friendly fashion. &ldquo;Hope so. It&rsquo;s quiet in town. We&rsquo;re all
      climbing &lsquo;March Hill,&rsquo; you know&mdash;dull time in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to start something, sir.&rdquo; I was telling him the truth then. I
      had just started something over in the town office. I sat down and picked
      up a newspaper from the table and began to show great interest in reading
      so that I would not be obliged to talk. I was afraid he would get me
      cornered. I hung onto that paper as if it were a life-buoy&mdash;I read it
      from title to last line, advertisements and all. It was the <i>Mechanicsville
      Herald</i>, printed in a manufacturing city about thirty miles from
      Levant, and because I did not miss anything which was printed in it I
      noted that two concerns wanted cord-wood&mdash;and I had just mentioned
      the matter of cord-wood to my uncle. At all events, I was traveling on a
      singletrack lie in old Levant!
    </p>
    <p>
      I laid down that paper and did some mighty lively thinking. Then, to
      reassure myself, I gave my silk hat the least bit of a cock and marched to
      Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Celene herself opened the door so promptly after my ring that I had a cozy
      little suspicion that she had seen me coming and had hurried to meet me.
      She was very pretty in her morning gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, your ankle is so much better, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I watched you
      coming across the square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stepped back, inviting me to enter by her manner, and I walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew just what to do for it. It&rsquo;s pretty nigh all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led me to the sitting-room, and her mother rose and met me; Mrs.
      Kingsley was distantly polite, that was all. I was glad even for that much
      in the case of a Sidney, for I knew that Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s obedient wife
      was as careful in matching her opinions to his as she was in matching
      colors at the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask to be excused for calling so early in the day,&rdquo; I said, with my hat
      in the hook of my arm, and putting on my best manners. &ldquo;But this is a
      business call and I&rsquo;m in somewhat of a hurry. You heard me speak to your
      father, Miss Kingsley, about the wood-lot. Now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never presume to interfere in my husband&rsquo;s business matters,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Kingsley, looking half scared. &ldquo;I know nothing whatever about his
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am not asking you to do so&mdash;certainly not,&rdquo; I hurried to tell
      her. &ldquo;I shall do all my business directly with him. But to do so I need
      his address in the city. I have come to ask you for it. I suppose he left
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;so that I may send his mail.&rdquo; She looked relieved and gave
      me the name of a hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not presumed to sit down, though I was sure that Celene&rsquo;s eyes had
      asked me. I bowed and backed toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you. That&rsquo;s all I wanted. I am sorry I was obliged to intrude.&rdquo; I
      felt that I was certainly doing that little thing well. &ldquo;I may be obliged
      to call again, if you will allow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Kingsley hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you may call,&rdquo; blurted Celene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have to consult with you in a matter similar to this errand
      to-day,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry the judge is not here; in that case I
      would not be bothering you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to prevail on my husband to stay at home&mdash;he is not at all
      well&mdash;there are so many matters which need his attention here,&rdquo;
       complained Mrs. Kingsley. &ldquo;If we can help you with any information we&rsquo;ll
      be glad to doit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went away on that, and I guess I left a good impression that I was
      strictly business!
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling sure that the two of them were watching me, I put a lot of
      business snap into my gait when I returned to the tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Vose,&rdquo; I asked, briskly, &ldquo;how many hitches have you in your
      livery-stable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I include two road-carts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The road-carts are all right, too. I want to use all of &rsquo;em, if
      you can furnish drivers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy enough to find men in these slack times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And probably farmers and day&rsquo;s-work men in the back districts of the town
      would like a job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can bet on it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Start eight men going, then, as soon as you can get the horses hitched
      in. Have the messengers pass the word that I can use two hundred husky
      men. Each man to report here in the tavern yard to-morrow morning at
      six-thirty with a sharp ax on his shoulder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what else&mdash;tell &rsquo;em what else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But about wages&mdash;and what they&rsquo;re to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell &rsquo;em nothing. They&rsquo;ll come running in here to find out what
      it&rsquo;s all about, Mr. Vose. Don&rsquo;t even tell &rsquo;em who wants &rsquo;em.
      You and I both know how curiosity itches in this town till it has been
      properly scratched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; agreed the landlord. &ldquo;If you set out to hire &rsquo;em
      regular style they&rsquo;d want to hem and haw and haggle about so long and so
      much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want a deposit for&mdash;&rdquo; I suggested, reaching toward a breast
      pocket which was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfrey domino, no!&rdquo; he protested, flapping his hands. &ldquo;If you have had
      to handle business in those suspicious ways down in the city I&rsquo;m sorry for
      you. Now forget money talk between us till it&rsquo;s time to talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was glad to do that, and I hoped that his ideas of time were liberal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I borrowed some blank paper and went up to my room and figured for many
      hours, stopping only to eat a good dinner&mdash;a boiled dinner in Vose&rsquo;s
      best style. My plate was piled high twice with corned beef fringed with
      golden fat, succulent disks of yellow carrots, wine-red beets, snowy white
      spuds, and odorous turnips. No man could possibly be a pessimist with that
      dinner under his belt! I had every reason to be the most apprehensive man
      in Avon County, but I had set my face to the front and I had just
      naturally made up my mind that I was going to pay for that dinner and for
      the other things which I had been recklessly ordering. I proposed to put
      myself into a position where I would be compelled to use every bit of my
      capital of cheek. The sweat stood, out on my forehead, but it wasn&rsquo;t the
      kind of moisture which could soften my grit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon, every time a steaming horse came homing back to Vose&rsquo;s
      stable, I felt a funny quiver inside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you have got a good line on human nature, young Sidney,&rdquo; stated
      the landlord, when I went down to the foreroom before supper. &ldquo;From what
      the men say this rushing around back district&rsquo;s with teams has got the
      boys all heifered up. Even if they don&rsquo;t come in to go to work, they&rsquo;ll be
      here to see what in tunket the hoorah&rsquo;s about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard my father say that this town was always ready to turn out to
      a bee,&rdquo; I told him. When I said it another thought came to cheer me&mdash;I
      had noticed that when a lot of men were set at work together on one job
      the natural spirit of rivalry put pep into the bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dodovah Vose went to his kitchen to give an eye to supper, I plucked
      a telegraph blank from his office desk. I nerved myself to try on my most
      audacious trick of all. I wrote this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To Ross Sidney, Levant.&mdash;Offer accepted. Go ahead with work. Will
      settle with you on my return.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Z. Kingsley.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I set my jaws and told myself that the message wasn&rsquo;t all falsehood; the
      last sentence was strictly true, even if Zebulon Kingsley did not pen it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I folded the paper, stuck it in my pocket, and went again to the Kingsley
      house. It was brazen business&mdash;a dangerous hazard. But I was
      depending on woman&rsquo;s inadequacy. I felt that I had the two of them sized
      pretty well. They had never presumed to meddle in the affairs of their
      master. They would not dare to question his will. I figured that sending
      him a wire asking corroboration of the message to me would seem to them
      like bold interference which would bring reproof from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited, respectfully standing, while they read the message, Celene
      looking over her mother&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more about the wood-lot matter,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;I think you heard
      your father make me a price on it. Miss Kingsley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember distinctly, mother. Father said he would sell for two thousand
      dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it must seem rather irregular,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but in my wire I
      explained that my people are in a great hurry&mdash;and I&rsquo;m glad that he
      has been willing to meet me half-way. It means that I am to put on a crew
      at once and cut the wood&mdash;and, of course, it&rsquo;s a safe proposition for
      the judge,&rdquo; I went on, forcing the best smile I could. &ldquo;Neither the land
      nor the wood can be carried away in a shawl-strap before he returns&mdash;I
      think he said in a week or ten days!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They returned my smile, and for the first time Mrs. Kingsley seemed rather
      cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you are taking it off his hands,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;It will be one
      less thing for him to worry about. He has been so troubled by his
      business. I&rsquo;m sure that he&rsquo;ll be glad to get rid of a lot more property in
      the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My soul whispered its doubts!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope that the matter is all clear now and that you have a good
      understanding, Mrs. Kingsley. You will explain, will you, if anybody comes
      to you in regard to the matter or questions my authority?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, Mr. Sidney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She exchanged glances with her daughter and they seemed to understand each
      other quickly. While we had been talking I heard the subdued clatter of
      supper preparations in another room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel sure that if my husband were here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Kingsley, &ldquo;he would
      extend the hospitality of our house to a gentleman who was obliging him in
      a business matter. Won&rsquo;t you stay and take supper with us, Mr. Sidney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without replying, I gave my hat into the ready hands of Celene and sat
      down weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was tickled nigh foolish&mdash;I&rsquo;ll admit that. But I was not wholly
      taken in by that hospitality play. Mrs. Zebulon Kingsley had known too
      much about me and my breed-to feel any great hankering to have me as a
      guest. But I was willing to bet a big plum that she was thinking a lot
      about my uncle&rsquo;s hostility and about the judge&rsquo;s fear of that rambunctious
      town official. And I was also sure that certain matters had been talked
      over between her and Celene since my arrival in town with such outward
      emblems of importance and prosperity. Furthermore, had I not fairly
      promised the daughter that I would do my best in the line of
      uncle-busting?
    </p>
    <p>
      So I held on to my emotions as best I could and waited for the subject to
      come up. It did, of course. I had not been in the house ten minutes before
      Mrs. Kingsley burst out. She was full of that topic. She saw in my uncle&rsquo;s
      attitude nothing but a wanton desire to make trouble for a good and great
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been thinking over the matter of that hostility since my morning&rsquo;s
      talk with Uncle Deck. I had been developing a sharp-ended suspicion that
      my uncle had something up his sleeve with which to arm that hostility.
      Judge Kingsley would never have pulled his wife into a row he was having
      with Decker Sidney unless desperation had moved him. I was bitterly
      ashamed and grieved when I listened to her description of that unutterable
      interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for her, she had no suspicions as to her husband&rsquo;s integrity&mdash;I
      could see that! The picture she made of the affair was of a mad dog
      chasing a saint!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what does the man think he can do to my husband? He can do nothing.
      He must realize it. What has he said to you, Mr. Sidney? I ask you, for I
      am sure you do not approve, his actions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Celene, and answered that I certainly did not approve, nor had
      I ever approved many things my uncle did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say further that I did what I could to-day to turn him from his
      grudge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what does he think he can do to my husband?&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;I suppose
      he told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he did not, madam. He said he did not trust me. He twitted me with
      having betrayed him once before to the judge&mdash;about the doctored
      horse,&rdquo; I added, with a sickly grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, of course, you&mdash;his own nephew&mdash;you produced some effect
      on him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I made him so mad he would have struck me if he had dared. That&rsquo;s
      all the effect I seemed to produce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears came into her eyes. &ldquo;How will it end?&rdquo; she quavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not feel like bragging just then about any powers of mine in the
      matter; I had plenty on my mind and conscience as it was. I was distinctly
      aware of being glad I had had that boiled dinner, and plenty of it, and I
      say that much with all due respect for the blessed presence of Celene at
      the supper-board. For between my ever-swelling love for her, my
      self-consciousness at table, my shame on account of my uncle, and my
      general emotions, anyway, I could scarcely choke down a mouthful. And at
      the end I was wholly and fairly rattled&mdash;that expression seems to fit
      my state of mind better than anything I can think of right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      She accompanied me to the door that evening when I departed&mdash;Mrs.
      Kingsley allowed her to go alone, evidently having elevated me to the
      plane of, at least, a buttonhole friend of the family after hearing of my
      quarrel with my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      And being rattled, and seeing the grieved anxiety in her eyes, and knowing
      how much distress must be tearing at her poor heart, I gulped out that I
      would put my uncle where he belonged. I was saying to myself that I would
      see him in tophet before I&rsquo;d allow his persecution to harm those innocent
      women, and I came nigh saying that to her in my excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put out to me both of her hands, and I took them. I tossed all
      prudence over the rail then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s got to be a fight in the Sidney family, then there&rsquo;ll be one!
      You tell your mother to sleep easy. I&rsquo;ll take this thing in hand from now
      on and I won&rsquo;t have your father abused by anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was talking as big as old Lord Argyle, and I knew I was babbling like a
      fool&mdash;bu t what can&rsquo;t a girl&rsquo;s wet eyes do to a fellow&rsquo;s common,
      sense?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We trust you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have made me so happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bent down and kissed her dear hands, first one and then the other. When
      I straightened up and saw the flush on her cheeks and the shy pleasure in
      her eyes I went the limit without stopping to take thought. I put my arms
      around her and kissed her on the lips&mdash;and no honest man can look me
      squarely in the eye and tell me there&rsquo;s any memory like the remembrance of
      the first kiss from one&rsquo;s own true love! For the first true love is not
      merely maiden&mdash;she has elements of the goddess in her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, having presumed so much with a goddess, I was immediately
      frightened and found myself ready to struggle with apology&mdash;and
      apology did not fit that occasion. So I ran away before I made more of a
      fool of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; I whispered from the gate. &ldquo;I love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She closed the big door very softly and I gathered good omen from that.
    </p>
    <p>
      How bright the stars were when I looked at them through my tears! A
      half-century ago a Yankee poet wrote these verses when he was in love:=
    </p>
    <p>
      ````When twilight&rsquo;s sable curtain falls,
    </p>
    <p>
      `````Then stars stand thick at even ````To act as outside sentinels
      `````Around the gates of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      ````That night along the shimmering slant,
    </p>
    <p>
      `````(I tell you true, my brother)
    </p>
    <p>
      ````The password was &ldquo;Almira Grant&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      `````They whispered to each other.=
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew mighty well what was their password that March night when I walked
      away from Celene.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not fit for any tavern society just then. Impulse seized upon me and
      I went down into the orchard. True love does not forget his trails and his
      caches! I found the tree with the hollow trunk and slipped my hand into
      the hole; I pulled forth the little packet of three rings. I reckoned that
      when I got my courage and my voice I would have a story to tell her&mdash;some
      evidence of love longstanding to offer&mdash;and that I&rsquo;d find those rings
      pretty valuable as exhibits A, B, and C.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were quite a number of gossiping loafers in the tavern foreroom when
      I marched in at last and took my room key from its hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there had been any doubt among them as to my importance in the world,
      that doubt must have vanished when they looked on me that night; for if I
      did not feel at that moment that the world was mine, nobody ever did!

      XII&mdash;STARTING SOMETHING IN LEVANT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE men were there
      in the morning&mdash;a mob of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came riding and they footed it into the village. The tavern office
      was crowded and the yard was full.
    </p>
    <p>
      The growing buzz of them woke me before sunup, and I wasted no time in
      dressing and getting down.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just as I had expected&mdash;the spirit of a lark was in them. They
      were not like men who had come dragging themselves to work. The men I knew&mdash;and
      I knew a lot of them on account of my early goings and comings about the
      countryside on my uncle&rsquo;s affairs&mdash;were on my back in a moment, their
      mouths full of questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was not ready to talk turkey till I had settled on one point, and I
      told them to be easy for a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I needed one man for a special purpose. I had left the selection of that
      man for morning, feeling instinctively that I would do better to pick from
      the crowd than to give away my plans overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw him inside of ten seconds. It was as clear a case of the right man
      for the job as if I had specified and had received the goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was Henshaw Hook, the best-known man in that section, the town
      auctioneer. He had the gift of gab, the science of talking all men into
      good humor, and was as alert in all his doings as a cricket on a hot
      spider.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took him by the arm and rushed him up to my room. Mr. Hook had brought
      no ax to the levee; he told me, by way of explanation, that he had come
      around out of curiosity. So had a lot of others, I knew well enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dodovah Vose followed us, for I had summoned him by a jerk of my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Hook, here&rsquo;s the story short and snappy,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;I
      represent a big syndicate which is buying all kinds of property. I have
      bought Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s wood-lot for the sake of what is on it&mdash;and
      it must be cleaned off in a hurry. Of course, I can&rsquo;t hang around town to
      attend to that part of the business. I need an able man who can attend to
      it.&rdquo; I pulled out my papers and inspected my figures. &ldquo;Mostly we are after
      hardwood&mdash;cord-wood! Do you suppose you can pull a hundred or so good
      workers out of that crowd downstairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep!&rdquo; snapped Hook. &ldquo;Mebbe more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was just as brisk as I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newspaper had given me quotations in its market column, and I had
      chopped cord-wood in my own young life. Furthermore, in my everlasting
      scurryings after squirrels and birds I had made many explorations on Judge
      Kingsley&rsquo;s domains. I was fully prepared to talk business, therefore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hook, green cord-wood is selling for five dollars a cord. It&rsquo;s a poor
      man with an ax who can&rsquo;t chop, trim, and pile his cord a day&mdash;four-foot
      length. If you can put two hundred men on that job and will abide by the
      rules of my syndicate, you can turn a profit of around fifty dollars a day
      for your own pocket&mdash;for I offer you five per cent, on five dollars a
      cord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hook promptly showed much interest. &ldquo;You said rules?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said rules!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spill,&rdquo; invited Mr. Hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out your pencil and make notes&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll ask you to do the same,
      Mr. Vose, so that there&rsquo;ll be no comeback!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They obeyed promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to do all my business with you&mdash;you are to do all the business
      with the choppers. You are the responsible party in all the details. You
      are to keep the books, measuring each man&rsquo;s daily cut and giving him due
      credit. He is to be paid two dollars and fifty cents a cord&mdash;a weekly
      bonus of twenty-five dollars to the man who comes across with the most
      cords! No payment to be made for two weeks and then one week&rsquo;s pay will be
      held back so that the men will not quit on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know about their agreeing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the syndicate doesn&rsquo;t want them. There&rsquo;s no chance for argument.
      We&rsquo;ll see how many volunteer when you put the matter up to &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;m
      going to leave the speechmaking to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fairly handy with my tongue,&rdquo; he said, with a grin. &ldquo;So I know. And I
      must be sure that <i>you</i> will not quit. That would disorganize the
      whole thing. All money to the men must go through your hands. Therefore,
      Mr. Hook, you must deposit with me, so as to cinch your responsibility,
      the sum of five hundred dollars in cash before axes start this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That idea did not please Mr. Henshaw Hook&mdash;not for a minute! He
      looked pretty blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any option in the matter,&rdquo; I stated, coldly. &ldquo;The syndicate
      makes its rules&mdash;but you can see that&rsquo;s a common-sense one. I
      couldn&rsquo;t be jumping around the country, leaving behind a lot of operations
      running by guess and by gosh, nobody financially responsible for the
      details.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corporations have to have their rules, Hen,&rdquo; said helpful Landlord Vose.
      &ldquo;We all know how young Sidney, here, has come along in the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sortwells have advertised that all right,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t working for dubs, Hen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not! But with the judge out of town I can&rsquo;t dig up more than
      three hundred and fifty this morning, not even if I went and robbed my old
      woman&rsquo;s work-basket!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Needn&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; said Dodovah Vose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got public spirit and
      I want to see business get a hump on in this town. I&rsquo;ll lend you enough to
      make up the five hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hook devoted thirty seconds to meditation. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;what did I
      understand you to say your concern is?&rdquo; he queried with assumed innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say&mdash;we are not advertising; we are pussyfooting so that
      they won&rsquo;t be boosting land values on us,&rdquo; I said, serenely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But among friends&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News travels faster among friends than anywhere else. Mr. Hook, I&rsquo;m not
      going to risk my job by shooting off my mouth. You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve come
      back to my home town to work a flimflam trick, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll grab in on this myself rather than see the plan dumped,&rdquo; stated the
      landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down and put the thing up to the boys,&rdquo; offered Hook, hastily.
      Fifty dollars and over a day had properly baited this Hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our auctioneer was a good talker! When&mdash;as he put it to them amidst
      laughter&mdash;he asked the sheep to separate from the goats, more than a
      hundred and fifty men stepped to one side and waved their axes as signal
      that they were ready to go to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifteen minutes later, closeted with Vose and Hook in my room, I was
      counting the deposit money&mdash;a fat bundle of bills; I had made ready
      for that part of the ceremony and I had an equally fat packet of blank
      paper in the drawer of my little table. I had not sat at the feet of my
      crook acquaintances without hearing much about the &ldquo;substitution trick.&rdquo; I
      worked it then and there on those guileless old countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I merely yanked out a table drawer with the casual remark about an
      envelope, turned my back for an instant, and then slipped into an envelope
      in full view of them a financial sandwich; I had made that sandwich by
      flicking two bills off the money-packet and framing the blank paper. I
      licked the mucilage, sparked down the flap, and handed the packet to
      Landlord Vose. I left the rest of the money in the drawer and slammed it
      shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you have wax and a seal down-stairs, Mr. Vose. Please daub on a
      little and lock this up in your safe. Then Mr. Hook and you and I will
      feel all right about our affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I led the gang to the wood-lot, and that plug-hat of mine must have
      flashed in the March sunlight about as brightly as the helmet of Henry of
      Navarre&mdash;providing I remember my <i>Fourth Reader</i> selection. That
      wad of bills which I had frisked out of the table drawer was bulked
      against my ribs in most comforting manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never saw men pitch into a job more cheerfully than those chaps did
      after I led them over the fence and gave the word. It was a real frolic.
      Men bantered one another and made side bets on ability and everybody was
      laughing. Axes sounded in a chick-chock chorus, and trees began to crash
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent the most of the day on the job, for I saw opportunities for extra
      profits; there was quite a stand of hackmatack, for instance, and there
      was a lot of cedar which fringed a small swamp. I made special bargains
      with men to fell this stuff for railroad ties. There was also considerable
      pine suitable for, box stuff; before the day was over a portable-sawmill
      man, hearing of the onslaught on the Kingsley lot, came hurrying to the
      village, made a trade for the pine, and paid down a sizable deposit;
      advertising was certainly paying!
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most interested onlookers was my uncle Deck, who drove dose to
      the wood-lot fence and scowled and sliced the air with his whip. He made
      several trips during the day and was handy by when I started to walk back
      to the village in the late afternoon. He offered a seat in his wagon and I
      accepted, for I was all done being scared of him and I was footsore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recorded your deed yet?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; I said, airily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not, seeing that you haven&rsquo;t got any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I let it go at that, having no sensible explanation to give a business man
      like my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, as it stands,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a case of neck-and-neck whether <i>he&rsquo;ll</i>
      jew you or <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> jew <i>him</i>. As bad as I hate <i>him</i> I&rsquo;m
      getting to hate <i>you</i> worse! I hope he&rsquo;ll stick you. But I doubt it.
      A young pirate who can step in here and steal a whole wood-lot right under
      the noses of men who ought to know better is qualified to give old Judas
      I-scarrot lessons in deviltry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you for feeling pleased and for praising me, Uncle Deck. I
      certainly am doing credit to your training.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as first selectman of this town I&rsquo;ve got a reputation to look after,
      and where will I get off with one of my blood and name serving time in
      State prison for grand larceny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not going to State prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will, with that old devil after you, surer&rsquo;n hell&rsquo;s down-hill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re sort of partners, the judge and I.&rdquo; I decided that I might as well
      give him a jolt or two, even if his common sense did tell him that I was
      lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bah-h-h!&rdquo; he yelped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as his partner I want to warn you against trying to trig his business
      affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He almost yanked the jaw off his horse, pulling the animal to a
      standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Condemn your young tripe! You are about as much a partner of his as a
      pullet is partner of a polecat! Don&rsquo;t you talk up to me! If you are trying
      to cheat him I&rsquo;ll help you do it. But if you are trying to help him, down
      goes your house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I propose to help him&mdash;help his family,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my surprise he held himself in. &ldquo;Help him how?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, by making you quit hounding him, for one thing. It&rsquo;s time this
      foolish old row was stopped. I am taking a special interest in Judge
      Kingsley&rsquo;s family in these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down to brass tacks, now! You mean just what you say, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I most certainly do, Uncle Deck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to call me uncle, you wall-eyed pup! You have gone to
      leaning up against that girl like a tomcat cuddling a warm brick, have
      you? You&rsquo;re letting her fool you along&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut that dirty mouth of yours!&rdquo; I shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of this wagon&mdash;out with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I obeyed promptly, for I had had plenty of his society.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waggled his whip-lash close to my nose when I stood in the road. &ldquo;When
      you get into State prison, where you belong,&rdquo; he snarled, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have a
      chum there. For that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m going to send old Kingsley, so help me
      the living God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he curled the lash with all his might under the belly of his horse,
      taking it out on the poor brute, and tore away, with the animal on the
      dead run.
    </p>
    <p>
      I trudged along in the dust he left flying. A fine chance I stood of
      handling my uncle Deck!
    </p>
    <p>
      A precious lot of fool babbling that talk had been at the front door of
      the Kingsley house the night before!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, I went to the house again that evening, for I had a business
      excuse. I told mother and daughter that certain urgent matters called me
      out of town and that I would be leaving early in the morning. I had a word
      or two to say about my arrangements for clearing the lot so that their
      minds might be at ease if any gossip came to them; in country communities
      there are busybodies who are always guessing at mischief and are trying to
      make trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remained with them only a short time, for I was afraid they would try to
      get consolation out of me regarding my uncle and I was not in the mood to
      do any more lying. I was in a generally uncomfortable state of mind,
      anyway, and I knew that Celene was troubled by my manner. There seemed to
      be sense of impending evil hovering over the three of us. Frankly, my
      uncle&rsquo;s threat regarding the judge had thrown a good-sized scare into me;
      Uncle Deck had truly acted as if he knew what he was talking about. My own
      conscience was creaking considerably inside me. When I rose to go Celene
      did not see me to the door. She gazed at me tenderly when I stated that I
      would be back in a few days, but some sort of reserve kept her at her
      mother&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stars were certainly not so bright that night when I walked back to
      the tavern. In my gloom a memory popped into my mind, queerly enough. I
      remembered that Dodovah Vose had loaned me ten dollars the night he helped
      me to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      I plucked a bill out of my breast pocket and handed it to him when I
      walked into the tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse the delay,&rdquo; I pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sure will,&rdquo; he replied, heartily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an honest chap, young
      Sidney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I was far from feeling honest that night.

      XIII&mdash;THE MAN WHO TALKED IN THE DARK
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>EXT morning
      Dodovah Vose drove me to the railroad station at the Lower Comers. He
      looked at the trip as a sort of a triumphal parade, and said so to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some different from that night ride we took, young Sidney,&rdquo; he chuckled.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m playing hackman this time so as to take the taste of that other ride
      out of my mouth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet, as I rode that morning by his side, I was wondering whether I would
      have courage to come back to Levant. Panic was in me&mdash;it truly was!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty scared little bug was you that night! But I always knew you had
      sprawl and gumption in you. Now you&rsquo;re showing the old town a thing or two
      and I&rsquo;m proud of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His praise made me cringe more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we passed the wood-lot a merry rick-tack of axes sounded in our ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir! You have shown them all that you can come back here and start
      something,&rdquo; stated Landlord Vose. He did not realize how infernally right
      he was. What I had started was setting the willy-wallies to dancing in my
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things have come along with such a rush that I haven&rsquo;t thought to ask you
      how you happened to hit it off so smooth with the judge,&rdquo; he proceeded,
      and my alarm increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met him on the road, and we turned a quick trade on the spot. He was
      starting for the city and we had to trade sudden or not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That hasn&rsquo;t been the judge&rsquo;s usual way in business,&rdquo; he commented,
      sagely. &ldquo;I have had some dealings with him myself, and so I know his style
      pretty well.&rdquo; He gave me a sly, sideways glance. &ldquo;Yes, I know him so well
      that I&rsquo;ve noticed how he&rsquo;s losing his grip on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you think he has been losing money, too?&rdquo; I plumped at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; drawled Vose, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how much money he&rsquo;s got nor what sort
      of investments he&rsquo;s carrying or how much money he has been handling for
      other folks, for he has always been cussed secret in his operations. And
      the folks who have turned money over to him have been secret, too, for I
      reckon he has helped them hide their money away from the tax-assessors.
      But I&rsquo;ll tell you, young Sidney, his money, however much he&rsquo;s got, must be
      pretty well tied up these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I questioned him with a side-glance which met his own. &ldquo;Because when old
      Rollins died a few months ago the heirs lit on the judge for the money he
      had in his hands&mdash;for the heirs are spenders and wanted the money to
      toss away. The judge&rsquo;s home place is in his wife&rsquo;s name and she mortgaged
      it to raise the money&mdash;and when a man mortgages the roof over his
      family&rsquo;s head he does need money, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are times when a man doesn&rsquo;t like to sacrifice securities,&rdquo; I
      said. Somehow I felt as if I had been specially delegated to stand up for
      the Kingsley family. &ldquo;Maybe so! Maybe so!&rdquo; agreed Vose. &ldquo;Finance is a
      strange critter&mdash;and the judge is a regular financier. But, I swan,
      if I like the looks of the strangers he has been doing business with for a
      long time back. I ain&rsquo;t any kind of a hand to pry into the dealings of men
      who put up at my tavern. Those fellows always paid their bills and showed
      plenty of money, but it don&rsquo;t seem to me as if straight business needs to
      be so blamed secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, the big fellows in money affairs keep their cards pretty dose to
      their vests,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe so! But he&rsquo;s selling property off slapdash&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Kingsley says he wants to get rid of some of his cares.&rdquo; Perhaps she
      had not said just that&mdash;but I had taken the rôle of the family
      champion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe so&mdash;and if that&rsquo;s the case, it&rsquo;s too bad your uncle Deck is
      rampaging so. Generally, we all trust the judge and look up to him, and we
      don&rsquo;t want to see him bothered at this time in his life. But here&rsquo;s your
      uncle trying to stir, up enough sentiment to call a special town meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; I was more alarmed than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His excuse is that the town is now so prosperous that we can afford to
      pay off the whole town debt by a little extra splurge in taxation. Says
      that with the debt all paid off new industries can be induced to locate
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But does that mean anything against Judge Kingsley? It looks to me like
      enterprise on Uncle Deck&rsquo;s part.&rdquo; Again Mr. Vose chanted his everlasting
      and singsong, &ldquo;Maybe so!&rdquo; Then he added: &ldquo;But I reckon your uncle Deck has
      more visible property spread around this town than any other taxpayer in
      it. Maybe he has had a change of heart about money. Maybe he intends to
      loosen up in his old age. Maybe he wants to hand something back to a town
      he has gouged all his life. But from what I know of your uncle Deck, I
      don&rsquo;t think he has grown so cussed patriotic all of a sudden. Young
      Sidney, I reckon there&rsquo;s a hotter and livelier reason. Your uncle has been
      nursing a grudge till it&rsquo;s well-grown and all haired out. That grudge is
      prancing, and he&rsquo;s willing to pay high for a chance to show its paces in
      public. And there&rsquo;s more in the plan of that special town meeting than
      shows on the surface at present writing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, when I climbed on board the train I had plenty to think about
      outside the immediate business I had in hand, though that was enough for
      one poor mind, Lord knows!
    </p>
    <p>
      Take everything, by and large, I was in the prime mess of my young life up
      to date.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal reason why I stayed in it, I suppose, was because I didn&rsquo;t
      know any better! That reason has accounted for a lot of my experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the best fights on the records have been won by men who were worst
      scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      I alighted in Mechanicsville in a state of mind I&rsquo;ll not attempt to
      describe. But I looked at myself in a store window and made up a business
      face to go with my appearance. I hired the best hack in sight, I started
      on a round of factories, wood merchants, brick-yards, and lumber-dealers.
      I rode up to the doors of offices in style; I walked in on &rsquo;em in
      style.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly a new wrinkle in wood-peddling&mdash;this plug-hat
      performance! It opened all doors to me. I don&rsquo;t know what they thought I
      was, before I opened my mouth, but I was not kept twiddling my thumbs in
      anterooms; the main squeeze in every office shunted all else in order to
      greet me. I wonder what would have been my lot if I had come as a
      stammering farmer, a crude countryman, or a chopper in wool boots!
    </p>
    <p>
      I sold wood! By gracious, I did!
    </p>
    <p>
      I found out something all of a sudden. I discovered that I had the art of
      salesmanship. It&rsquo;s an art, a qualification hard to describe. Every man who
      has ever bought anything knows what it is and how it has operated in his
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sold wood and lumber and sleepers&mdash;and the more I sold, the higher
      rose my confidence in my personality, and I had hard work to control and
      conceal my hysterics of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked off onto brick-yards even the crooked limbs, the second-grade
      stuff which I had seen piling up on my operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      With every buyer I made written contracts, designating prompt delivery on
      certain dates, first deliveries to be made within a week and calling for
      cash payments of two-thirds of value of wood delivered, the whole amount
      to be paid when final delivery was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went on down the line to another city and then to a third. I sold wood!
      I sold for three days. Then I woke up and stopped selling. It occurred to
      me that I might be overguessing on the resources of the Kingsley wood-lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not a mite of trouble in arranging with the division superintendent
      of the railroad line for a supply of gondola cars; I was offering
      something worth his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left that gentleman in mighty abrupt fashion; he must have thought that
      I was a very precipitate business man. But while I was winding up my
      arrangements with him, I looked out of his office window in the railroad
      station into the windows of a train which was pulling slowly out, on its
      way up-country. I caught a glimpse of a stem profile with a roll of
      chin-beard under it. If that face did not belong to Zebulon Kingsley&mdash;But
      I did not stop to do any more thinking on the matter. I galloped out of
      that office. I had to chase that train a hundred yards down the platform&mdash;but
      I made the last car!
    </p>
    <p>
      Zebulon Kingsley home ahead of schedule!
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood on the car steps, getting my breath, giving dizzy thought to the
      peril I had so narrowly missed. Zebulon Kingsley back in Levant ahead of
      me, viewing his desolated wood-lot and voicing his fury! Where would my
      character and importance land after that blow-up?
    </p>
    <p>
      Did I say that my dizzy thoughts dealt with a peril I had missed? In about
      ten seconds I decided that I was traveling right along with the peril. I
      was doomed to drop into Levant in its company.
    </p>
    <p>
      I might have been mistaken, I reflected. I hoped I had been deceived by a
      too-hasty glance. I walked down through the train. I was pretty sure of my
      man when I passed him, though I got a view of the back of his head only.
      Therefore I went to the front of the car, making an excuse of the
      water-cooler. I looked back at him while I drank. He seemed to be asleep,
      for his head was bent down into the folds of the cape he had pulled about
      his ears. I was so sure he was asleep that when I went back up the car I
      gave him a bold look to convince myself I had not been mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got one of the starts of my life!
    </p>
    <p>
      Zebulon Kingsley was distinctly not asleep. His eyes were like fire-balls,
      and he stared straight at me without one flicker of the lids or crinkle of
      the countenance to show that he recognized me. His face was gray and
      haggard. He was like a stone man. If he had given one hint by his
      expression that he knew me I would have pushed myself in beside him, I
      reckon, and would have come across with my little story. But that frozen
      face was too much for me. I was doing a lot of guessing about his state of
      mind, and my guesses warned me to stay away from him just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hurried past and sat down in the first vacant seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feeling I had was that he had found out by letter from home or somehow
      what kind of a trick I had cut up. Those glaring eyes hinted at
      unutterable things. He must be in such a fury, I thought, that words had
      failed him. He was waiting until he stepped foot in Levant to go at me in
      proper style. Naturally, he would not start anything on a railroad train.
      I sat there while those, thoughts flamed up in me like fire in a
      brush-heap, and for a long time I found no handy extinguisher for those
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there was a rather comforting packet in the breast pocket of my
      frock-coat; I got out those contracts and went over them carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did have some visible emblems of success to stick up in front of his
      sour face when it came to a showdown. But if Zebulon Kingsley was not
      willing to start anything in public on a train, neither was I. I studied
      my contracts, added figures, and tried to keep my mind off the big trouble
      ahead. But who has ever sat near a bomb with a sputtering fuse and felt in
      a mood for philosophy? I couldn&rsquo;t even add figures!
    </p>
    <p>
      The train bumped on and on. It was a long ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we arrived at Levant Corners, I followed Kingsley so closely that we
      almost walked in a lock-step. I had a sort of crazy notion that if he
      started to bawl me out on the platform and expose me to the populace I&rsquo;d
      choke him and drag him off somewhere for an explanation, for I truly did
      have a face to save in Levant.
    </p>
    <p>
      I trod behind him on the station platform. Far up the platform was waiting
      a man who wore a constable&rsquo;s badge. I itched all over as we approached
      that man; I fully expected that the judge would whirl and point me out and
      call for my arrest. But the constable touched his hat respectfully and the
      judge marched on. I almost bumped into him when he stopped at hail of a
      citizen. I was forced to go on, then. The citizen had buttonholed the
      judge on some matter of business, but by the few words I heard I knew it
      was no affair of mine. I ran my eye over the array of hitches waiting in
      the station yard, expecting to see Celene Kingsley. But she was not there.
      Her absence hinted to me that her father was not expected. Then he would
      ride on the stage! I resolved to walk on and to hail it when it overtook
      me. I proposed to be on the scene when Judge Kingsley got first peep at
      what had been his wood-lot. I kept looking behind and noted that he walked
      past the stage-coach and had started to foot it on my trail. Therefore he
      was not expected at home, and for reasons of his own had decided to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I saw that the stage had come on without him and had observed that he
      shook protesting hand at persons who stopped and offered a lift, I walked
      on more briskly. He wanted to be left alone, then! His expression had
      already hinted to me that he had no use for companionship at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I could hear my ax-men. Their blades were biting wood in lively
      chorus, though the dusk was gathering. I realized that the spirit of
      rivalry was in them and that they were not watching the clock on that job.
      When I came in sight of the wood-lot I saw that a big expanse had been
      cleared, down to the bushes; the bared land was thickly dotted with wood
      which was tiered in cord lots. I hardly recognized the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notion struck me that this was the proper strategic point to await the
      battle. In the first place, I would not be obliged to waste any breath in
      telling Zebulon Kingsley that his wood-lot was being cleared; his eyes
      would inform him on that point. I could devote all my language and energy
      to the job of enlightening him regarding my activities in the matter, my
      hopes and his prospects of getting some money. Secondly, considering
      strategy, my appearance before my men, accompanied by Judge Kingsley,
      after I got him under control, would put the stamp of authority on the
      whole affair; I believed I could control him. He certainly would have to
      take the situation as he found it; he couldn&rsquo;t stick those trees back into
      the ground again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore I settled my plug-hat well on my head, pulled out my bunch of
      contracts, and waited for him to come around the bend in the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reflected that he had looked to me like a man who had a great deal of
      trouble on his mind. In my young days, when old dog Bonny was dreadfully
      afflicted with fleas I tied a tin can to his tail to take his mind off his
      troubles. I believe fully that changing the current of his thoughts for a
      time proved really restful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was certain that Judge Kingsley would have the current of his thoughts
      changed in a very few minutes. He would have something entirely fresh to
      think about, and I hoped it would do him good, even though I received no
      thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed pretty much cast down when he shambled into sight, his shoulders
      bowed, staring at the road ahead of him. But all at once he straightened,
      threw back his head, and seemed to sniff the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charge!&rdquo; I said to myself. And he set his elbows akimbo under his cape
      and came at a trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to rush past me on his way to the fence, but I stepped in front
      of him and threw up my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment, Judge Kingsley! This is my business&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your business be damned!&rdquo; he stuttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong talk for a Sunday-school teacher, but it made him seem more human
      and my courage rose a bit. I had not known how to tackle that frozen
      figure he looked to be in the railroad train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll explain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out what this set of infernal thieves&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wouldn&rsquo;t wait any longer, though I was trying to head him off with my
      arms outstretched. He drove past me and wrenched a post out of the fence
      and started to climb into the wood-lot. There was only one thing to do&mdash;I
      must get the upper hand of the infuriated old man before we attracted the
      attention of my busy workers; the dusk was helping me in that respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pulled the stake from him, held him by his arms, and set my face close
      to his; he was a scrawny old chap and he hadn&rsquo;t any muscle left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Kingsley, forgive me&mdash;but you must listen. It&rsquo;s best for all
      concerned. I have bought this lot from you and I am operating on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought he would choke to death before he got the words wrenched out of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t bought it. You couldn&rsquo;t buy it! There is no money passed.
      There&rsquo;s no deed. You&rsquo;re a thief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had dropped the bunch of contracts when I grabbed him. I released my
      clutch on one arm and picked up the packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something to show I am not a thief, sir. You&rsquo;ve got to look at &rsquo;em.
      And the middle of the road is no place for our business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, I noticed all at once that the choppers were giving up work
      and starting for the highway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably the most sensible way was for me to go along to his house,
      exhorting him to keep his mouth shut till he understood the matter. But a
      row with him in his own house would be exposing myself to Celene. I held
      his arm and hurried him across the road and into the woods opposite. He
      protested angrily, but I kept him on the move until we were in a little
      clearing which the red western skies still lighted enough for my purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      I flapped the contracts under his nose. &ldquo;You advertised the land&mdash;you
      gave me a price, Judge Kingsley. I know I have been irregular. I cannot
      stop now to explain why, but I have sold all the wood. Here are the
      contracts. Hunt up the men and make sure, if you don&rsquo;t believe writing and
      signatures. I&rsquo;ll let you go and collect your two thousand dollars before a
      dollar comes to me.&rdquo; I shoved the papers into his hands and he pawed them
      over without seeming to understand very well. &ldquo;Contracts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir! Contracts with responsible concerns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you arrested,&rdquo; he insisted, but his anger was dying out and he
      sort of whined, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my land; you haven&rsquo;t any right to make contracts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All at once his legs bent under him and he sat down on the ground. There
      was plainly something special the matter with Zebulon Kingsley!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; he mourned. &ldquo;Are all the blatherskites, thieves, and
      swindlers in this world on my track?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tie any of those kind of tags on to me, Judge Kingsley. It isn&rsquo;t
      fair!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have robbed me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it! Look at the contracts!&rdquo; He did not seem to be taking any
      interest in the papers; he merely waggled the packet about like a child
      waving a rattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First one, and then the other! They have robbed me. I am ruined!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I squatted down in front of him and made him look at me. I was in the mood
      for any kind of self-sacrifice. I wanted to beat it into his old head that
      there was one man who was trying to help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Kingsley, listen to me! You are sure of getting your two thousand
      dollars for your wood-lot. I say again, go yourself and collect the money.
      If my estimates are in any way near right&mdash;and I reckon I am inside
      the truth&mdash;there&rsquo;s around a thousand dollars profit in this deal,
      profit I was intending to take for myself. But, seeing that you feel as
      you do about my actions, I&rsquo;ll hand the whole thing over to you. Take it
      all! Come to me in the morning when you&rsquo;re feeling better and I&rsquo;ll explain
      my trade with Henshaw Hook and the choppers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me and never said a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even ask any pay for the time I have put in,&rdquo; I said, trying to
      make myself as much of an angel as I could, now that I was started on the
      savior trail. &ldquo;You understand, don&rsquo;t you? All you&rsquo;ve got to do is keep my
      promises to the men and pull down around three thousand in cash!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a story-book that would have been his cue to get up and clasp me to his
      breast. He simply blinked at me. I began to get a little warm in the
      region of my neckband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the way you feel about it, Judge Kingsley,&rdquo; I said,
      straightening up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bid you good evening. After you have tucked your
      three thousand in your jeans, send me a bill for damages and I&rsquo;ll settle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called me back before I had taken many steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My head isn&rsquo;t right,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;I have been having much trouble. What
      have you been telling me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went over the thing again, very patiently, for I saw I was dealing with
      a case which was more serious than I thought. The night was on us by that
      time. I tore strips of birch bark from a tree, lighted them one by one,
      and made a torch so that he could examine one of the contracts. Again I
      insisted that he must cake the whole thing over profits and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no right to start in on your property as I did, Judge Kingsley. So
      I&rsquo;ll fine myself a thousand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I ought to call you honest, young man,&rdquo; he said, after a time. &ldquo;I
      have hard work to believe that any man is honest in this world just now,
      but what you say sounds honest. I&rsquo;ll meet you half-way in your honesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He asked me to hold more torches. He found a sheet of letter-paper in his
      wallet, bearing his name printed at the top. He wrote a receipt for two
      thousand dollars, using the long wallet for his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have dated it four days back. Now that I have met you half-way in one
      matter, young man, I ask you to meet me half-way in another. When you get
      that, money in hand, pay it to my wife. Do not tell anybody that you did
      not pay it to me.&rdquo; He hesitated a moment. &ldquo;As to the land&mdash;the deed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no use for the land, Judge Kingsley. So there&rsquo;s no call for a
      deed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are honest, young man. I believe I can trust you to give the
      money to my wife&mdash;and say nothing about it outside!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can give it to you, sir, in a few days!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect to be away on business for some time,&rdquo; he said, curtly. &ldquo;Now
      understand! Whatever questions are asked by anybody you must insist that
      you paid that money to me. Your own interest requires it! Show the
      receipt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me for keeping you here so long in the dark and the cold, sir,&rdquo; I
      pleaded, realizing the situation all at once. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll let me call on
      you to-morrow I&rsquo;ll have something further to say about the matter of the
      profits&mdash;but I won&rsquo;t bother you any more to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Don&rsquo;t bother me to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I waited for him to come along with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, young man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Step along ahead if you will! I prefer
      to walk home alone&mdash;I have some business matters to run over in my
      head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I realized fully that Judge Zebulon Kingsley did not care to have a Sidney
      chumming with him before the eyes of Levant, and I did not take this
      dismissal in bad part. I marched off.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the memory of that face of his went with me. Fifty feet up in the road
      I stood stock-still. What did it mean&mdash;his command to hand over the
      money to his wife, making a secret of it? What made his eyes burn so
      redly? What was the matter with Judge Kingsley, anyway? I listened for his
      footsteps on the road behind me. I heard no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came to me that Celene Kingsley would have reason to blame me if I left
      her old father floundering around the woods in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went tiptoeing back, my ears perked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard him talking rapidly and clearly, not as one talks aloud in
      soliloquy, but as if he were addressing somebody. I stepped carefully in
      through the fringe of trees and I found out that Zebulon Kingsley <i>was</i>
      talking to somebody; he was talking to God!
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened five seconds and I realized what he was talking about. Then I
      leaped on him and struck his wrist with the edge of my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped a fat, ugly revolver which had glinted in the starlight. I
      pounced on it and flung it into the woods as far as muscle, fright, and
      anger could prevail. When I turned on the judge he had just tugged another
      revolver out of his pocket, twin of the other weapon. I had a tussle with
      him to get it, and he fairly squealed in his fury. But I wrenched the
      thing out of his clutch and threw it; then I pulled him to his feet and
      patted him all over, as a policeman frisks a prisoner, to make sure that
      he was not serving as arsenal for more artillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Kingsley,&rdquo; I kept saying over and over, &ldquo;your wife! Your daughter!
      Think of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to drag him out of the woods by main strength. I propelled
      him along the highway and he walked as stiffly as some kind of a wooden
      figure, moved by springs. His eyes stared straight ahead and his face was
      white in the starlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we came into the village without a word between us, and I led him by
      dark lanes to his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he held back and replied to what I had said in the woods as if I had
      just spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>am</i> thinking of them! That&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t face them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the tone in which he said that! Questions were crowding in my throat,
      but I did not dare to pry into troubles as deep as Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s most
      certainly were. But I had to have some assurance from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Kingsley,&rdquo; I said, with respect in my voice, &ldquo;I am meddling, but
      God knows there was a call for somebody to meddle just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to be out of my troubles!&rdquo; He was trembling like a leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not so much of a coward, Judge, that you&rsquo;ll shift off all of
      your troubles on to your family, along with the awful one you were just
      about to shove on them! I know you&rsquo;re not. I have always looked up to you,
      sir.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But nobody can look up to me from now on, young man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always shall, sir. We all get rattled some time in our lives.&rdquo; I knew I
      was making pretty poor talk to a man like Judge Kingsley, but I was
      trembling as badly as he was and I did not know what to say to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only poor Ross Sidney, sir. You know I don&rsquo;t amount to much, but
      won&rsquo;t you consider that I have done a little something for you this night?
      I stopped you when you didn&rsquo;t know what you were doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did know what I was doing,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;I was doing it because I
      couldn&rsquo;t go home. I walked up the road to the woods&mdash;to my woods on
      purpose to do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It came to me that fate, or whatever rules human actions, had set me to
      play quite a part in Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s life, for his private woods were not
      there&mdash;and <i>I</i> was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you consider me enough of a man, sir, so that I can ask a man-to-man
      promise that you&rsquo;ll sleep on this thing and have a talk with me to-morrow?
      I have helped you on one matter. I&rsquo;ll do my best to help you in other
      ways!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no help for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But let me have a talk to-morrow with you! I beg you, Judge Kingsley.
      Give me your promise till tomorrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stiffened up and scowled at me. He resented what I said, I could see. I
      guess he thought I was trying to be too familiar with him. The old chap&rsquo;s
      pride was still on tap. I suppose it seemed like lowering his dignity to
      make any sort of a man&rsquo;s compact with young Ross Sidney. However, I was
      glad to see pride bristle up a bit in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard of a Kingsley being a coward, Judge,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;Or being
      a liar, either! You owe me something, sir, and I&rsquo;ll insist on being paid
      with your promise. So I reckon I have it.&rdquo; I did not give him opportunity
      to do any talking. I rang the bell at the door, though he grabbed at my
      hand to stop me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go in now! My face&mdash;my conscience!&rdquo; So his conscience was
      still working!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave it all to me, sir. I&rsquo;ll fix it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid opened the door, and I led him into the sitting-room. Celene and
      her mother were there and they came to their feet, gasping with fright,
      for I was half carrying the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;it&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; I told them. &ldquo;We have been inspecting
      the work in the wood-lot on the way from the train. It&rsquo;s nothing, I say&mdash;just
      a little touch of the heart. The judge insisted on walking too much.&rdquo; I
      helped him to a couch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call in the morning on that business, sir!&rdquo; I
      told him. Then I turned to Celene, who was giving me warm welcome with her
      eyes, now that her fears were subsiding. &ldquo;Keep your eye on your father
      during the night,&rdquo; I advised her. &ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s nothing serious in his
      case&mdash;only a little overtasking of the heart&mdash;but a bit of home
      nursing will do him good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I reckoned I had planted a loyal sentinel over the man who was indebted to
      me for giving him more days of his life, even though they might be bitter
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to Dodovah Vose&rsquo;s tavern, feeling still more like an overloaded
      mule&mdash;saddled with plenty of my own troubles, to say nothing of other
      folks&rsquo;.

    <h2>
      XIV&mdash;THE KICK-BACKS IN THIS SAMARITAN BUSINESS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> WAS too much
      upset to go to sleep very early that night, even though Dodovah Vose had
      given me another of those slumber-coaxing suppers of fried chicken.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Zebulon Kingsley was ruined, according to his own tell!
    </p>
    <p>
      But what else besides ruin was fronting him? I knew him and the stuff that
      was in him. When a man like the judge came humping back to his home town,
      packing a gun on each hip and headed for his woods, there to do himself
      destruction, it meant something more than that he was flat broke. The fact
      that he had two guns suggested that he did not propose to take any chances
      on failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      His troubles might have skeow-wowed his mind temporarily, I pondered. The
      fact that he had given me, one of the despised Sidneys, a half-dozen
      decent words hinted at aberration, as I thought upon the matter. I hoped
      that he would stay crazy long enough so that he would allow me to poke
      myself still further into his affairs and his family, and show me a little
      appreciation. Up to that time I certainly had been using ax and crowbar on
      the intimacy proposition!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my conviction that he would be obliged to be pretty nice to me from
      that time on. I knew something very private and personal in regard to
      Judge Kingsley, Levant magnate! All at once I found myself feeling rather
      like sticking my thumbs in my vest armholes and showing condescension to
      that man who had loomed so largely before my admiration. At any rate, no
      Sidney had ever committed suicide or had tried to, unless it might be
      hinted that it mightily resembled suicide when my father ran the
      ridge-pole of the Butler barn after wetting down the occasion with a quart
      or so of hard cider.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt decidedly cocky when I started over to his house the next morning.
      I had his secret&mdash;I had manhandled him to save his life. A man might
      make up his mind to commit suicide, thought I, and then be particularly
      and almighty grateful, after a night&rsquo;s sleep, because some chap happened
      along at the right time and stopped him before he had made a fool of
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I headed for the front door like a friend of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Kingsley opened his office door in the ell and called to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not transact business in my home,&rdquo; he informed me, stiffly. He
      tapped the sign beside his door. &ldquo;Z. Kingsley&rdquo; was its sole inscription,
      curtly hinting that no further information was needed regarding that
      gentleman. &ldquo;I do all business in my office, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know in just what condition I had been expecting to find the
      judge, and I had not planned how I would act when I met him, but I know
      mighty well I had not calculated on the sort of meeting we did have.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found him just as I had found him in times past when we had had a word
      or so together&mdash;and that was my surprise that day!
    </p>
    <p>
      I would not have been much astonished if he had fallen on my neck and
      sobbed out his gratitude; I rather looked for some demonstration. To find
      him the same old, cold, stiff ramrod was outside all my anticipations. I
      went in meekly and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the matter of the wood-lot,&rdquo; he said, perfectly at ease and putting
      that jew&rsquo;s-harp twang in his nose. &ldquo;I have looked the contracts over.
      Young man, I don&rsquo;t know whether to compliment you as one of the smartest
      business men I have ever met, or to have you arrested for an attempt at
      grand larceny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not know what to say to that, and sat and fiddled my finger across
      the brim of my plug-hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put out his hand. &ldquo;Please allow me to look at that receipt I gave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I handed it over&mdash;obedient as a pup. He read it and tore it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as irregular a document as your operations have been irregular. I
      will give you a deed, taking back your note and a mortgage&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want no deed, sir. I said so to you last evening. I don&rsquo;t want the
      land. You keep it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave me a chilly stare. &ldquo;My price of two thousand dollars was on the
      lot&mdash;not merely the wood on the lot. The land will be yours when we
      have passed our papers. I don&rsquo;t know why I should place myself under
      obligations to you by any such foolish child&rsquo;s play as you suggest.&rdquo; Say,
      I felt myself slipping out of the Kingsley family circle as if I were
      going down a cellar slide in a puddle of soft soap. I made a desperate
      clutch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Kingsley,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I made you another offer last night. I offered
      to turn the whole proposition over to you&mdash;profits and all! I had no
      business starting in on the operation. If you are in some sort of trouble&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said I was in trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said so last evening,&rdquo; I faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you told anybody I said so, sir?&rdquo; he demanded, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir! Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you permit yourself to hint that to anybody I shall promptly brand you
      as a falsifier and have you before the court on the charge of slander. You
      must realize that I could secure large damages because a financial man&rsquo;s
      reputation forms his stock in trade. I could have you sent to prison on a
      criminal charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any need of your sitting there and threatening me in that
      fashion,&rdquo; I protested, with some heat. &ldquo;I have tried to help you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not asked for any of your help&mdash;I do not need it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you do,&rdquo; I admitted, sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I couldn&rsquo;t figure what his game was&mdash;it was his own business, anyway&mdash;but
      I did not propose to have him sneering at me. His manner when he said,
      &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; was mighty nasty. I rose and kicked my chair away from
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t show any gratitude if you don&rsquo;t feel like it, Judge Kingsley.
      You&rsquo;ll never hear a word from me about anything that has happened, but I&rsquo;m
      not keeping still because you have threatened me. I&rsquo;m keeping my mouth
      shut because I&rsquo;m man enough to do so! And, by gad! I hope you&rsquo;re man
      enough, on your side, to show me a little decency and to remember that you
      have a wife and daughter to protect from scandal and shame. Good day!&rdquo; I
      put on my hat and marched out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m making due allowance for the judge&rsquo;s state of mind, but truly that old
      hyampus did have the natural ability to stir a man&rsquo;s temper. A Kingsley
      and a Sidney got along together about as well as the two parts of a
      Seidlitz powder do when they meet in a glass of water!
    </p>
    <p>
      I slammed the door after me, but I had gone only a few feet when I
      remembered that I had left behind my contracts. Furthermore, I had not
      finished my business in regard to the deed and the payments. So I whirled
      and went back in without stopping to knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if he had been playing a part with me with a mask to hide his
      face! He had laid down the mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked on a fairly hideous scroll of awful, utter woe. That was his
      face. He was crumpled down in his chair. He did not look at me. I picked
      up the packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready to attend to the matter of the deed, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wagged his head weakly from side to side. &ldquo;Later!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Come
      later. Come this evening, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went down into the woods and hunted for hours until I found those two
      revolvers. That face of his was before me all the time. I expected to look
      up and find him hunting, too. There were other ways of committing suicide
      than by shooting, but I did not propose to leave those revolvers around
      loose, seeing that he had made up his mind to use that means of shuffling
      off. That face which he had exposed to me showed that Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s
      soul was near the limit of endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went about that day sick with fear. My helplessness in the matter was
      maddening. He was holding me off with his disdain like a man holding an
      enemy at bay with a pitchfork. And I knew that even if he gave me his
      confidence there was little a poor devil of my caliber could do in affairs
      such as his must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered if the knowledge that he was ruined was behind his desperate
      resolve to die. Of course he had a lot of pride, but other proud men had
      failed in business and lived through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to confess to myself that the judge must have a deeper
      motive. I remembered my uncle&rsquo;s threats and wondered what that disturber
      had up his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      I almost whipped my courage up to the point of tackling him on the
      subject, but when I met him on the street in the afternoon and fronted his
      savage scowl I walked right on past, minding my own little business. His
      face had an extra touch of flame in it that day. That he had something
      special on the docket was plain to be seen. I went down to the wood-lot
      and checked up with Henshaw Hook so as to be out of my uncle&rsquo;s way. His
      looks rather scared me. Just as I was walking away from the wood-lot at
      dusk he hopped out of his wagon ahead of me and tacked a printed paper to
      a wayside tree, glowering at me while I waited at a little distance. It
      was evident that he meant that paper especially for my attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I walked up and had a look at it when he was out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It called a special town meeting thirty days from that date. As was
      necessary in a call of that sort, the purpose of the meeting was stated:
      &ldquo;To see what action the town will take to pay off its indebtedness in
      full. Notice is hereby given that all creditors of the town must present
      notes or other evidences of claims at that meeting on the 15th day of
      April.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What did that call signify in the case of Zebulon Kingsley, town
      treasurer? I had seen behind his mask and I guessed! If I guessed rightly
      he would feel, when his eyes fell on that paper, like a man who had been
      notified of the date of his execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started on toward the village, and when I passed Brickett&rsquo;s duck-pond I
      threw the revolvers into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hurried to Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s house, for I had the excuse of business, and
      he himself had made the appointment. There was a light in his office, but
      it went out suddenly when I was some distance away. I started to run, and
      then I checked myself. I decided that caution rather than haste was
      needed. I was right. Standing behind a tree, I saw him come out of the
      office door in a sneaking fashion, the early evening hiding him. He went
      around the house, and I followed. Young eyes can see in the dark better
      than old ones, and he did not spy me where I stood in the dusk, watching
      him hack off with a jack-knife a section of the family clothes-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stooping and almost staggering he went down into the orchard, and I trod
      close behind him undetected, for the trees plastered shadows into which I
      dodged. I waited until he had settled a noose around his neck and had
      thrown an end of the cord over a limb. I was taking no chances on having
      any misunderstanding between Judge Kingsley and myself that trip. In my
      own way I was just about as desperate as he was. I marched up to him, took
      him by both arms and pushed him against the tree-trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in such a state, physically and mentally, that he did not protest
      or resist; it did not seem to frighten him specially to be overhauled in
      that fashion. Honestly, I felt like spanking his face as I would have
      whipped a child. This game of &ldquo;tag the suicide&rdquo; was getting on my nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Kingsley, you need a guardian and I have appointed myself one,&rdquo; I
      told him, and I was mighty resolute, for I had determined to brace up to
      him with all the power in me. &ldquo;You have no right to kill yourself, and
      you&rsquo;re not going to kill yourself, by gad! not if I have to camp with you
      day and night till you get back your nerve. I&rsquo;m going to take you straight
      to your folks and tell &rsquo;em you&rsquo;re out of your head temporarily and
      will have to be taken to a hospital!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That brought him out of his numbness, and I knew it would. I believe he
      would have struck me if his arms had been free. But I needed to have him
      in another mood than the fighting one. I hit him hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an embezzler!&rdquo; I cracked out. &ldquo;How much?&rdquo; He crumpled, and I let
      him slide down and sit on the ground, his back against the tree. It was
      the first time he had ever had that word put to him from man&rsquo;s mouth, even
      though he may have confessed to himself in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Kingsley,&rdquo; I said, bravely, knowing that I had an advantage from
      then on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a young man and I know you don&rsquo;t think much of me. But
      I&rsquo;m going to grab in on this thing, whether you want me to or not. I have
      special reasons of my own. I&rsquo;ll do everything I can to balk my uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a spy he has set on me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar!&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t going to take any of his sneers or his abuse. I
      hated to talk to him as I did, but only by being coarse and rough and
      bossy could I hope to pound anything helpful into him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared up at me with his jaw hanging down and I did not let up on my
      punches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have tried to head off my uncle Deck. I have told him straight out that
      I am for you and against him. He and I don&rsquo;t speak to each other. I have
      promised your wife and your daughter that I&rsquo;ll do everything I can to beat
      my uncle out in this thing. They don&rsquo;t understand it! I don&rsquo;t understand
      it all. But, before God, my promise to them is holy, even if you do not
      believe in me! I&rsquo;m in this affair and I&rsquo;m in to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to wag his head as he had done before that day. &ldquo;Brace up, Judge
      Kingsley! You&rsquo;re not licked yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those three selectmen have signed my death-warrant. That notice which has
      been posted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw that I had him going and I kept him going. &ldquo;But when an embezzler
      stays alive and does his best to straighten matters&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me that name!&rdquo; he groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will take me into your confidence, Judge Kingsley, so that I can
      turn to and help you, I swear before Almighty Jehovah that I will set to
      work for you with body and soul. I <i>can</i> help you&mdash;I know I can
      help. No man can feel as I feel and be useless! But let me tell you this
      much on the other side!&rdquo; I bent down and snapped my finger under his nose.
      That was no time for half-way and mealy-mouthed stuff. &ldquo;If you throw me
      down after this honest offer, it means that you think I&rsquo;m too cheap to be
      of use and too low to associate with. And that&rsquo;s an insult I&rsquo;ll never
      swallow! So help me, I&rsquo;ll drag you up into the village with that rope
      around your neck and blow the whole business and hand you over to those
      who will take care of you. I will! My mind is made up. Take your choice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am sure that with no less bitter alternative could I have jounced any of
      his secrets out of Zebulon Kingsley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just enough of a hellion to do that very thing if you don&rsquo;t treat me
      right,&rdquo; I warned him, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You leave me no choice in the matter,&rdquo; he mourned. &ldquo;You are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, sir! I&rsquo;m doing what I&rsquo;m doing out of pure and honest desire to
      help you. I want fair treatment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing can make my situation worse than it is, I suppose,&rdquo; he stated,
      after meditating for a time. &ldquo;On the fifteenth day of April it will become
      known in town meeting that more than ten thousand dollars of town notes
      are out, drawing interest and bearing my name as town treasurer. I have
      issued those notes without warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the people who hold them know they are out!&rdquo; He was coldly, numbly
      patient with me, the untamed animal who had promised to pounce on him and
      drag him to his shame in the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have borrowed the money in various small lots and in each case the
      note-holder is keeping absolutely still in order to escape taxation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But great Scott! Judge Kingsley, ten thousand dollars for a rich man like
      you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no longer rich. I am ruined. I cannot take up those town notes prior
      to the meeting. So I shall be arrested as a criminal! I have lost money
      intrusted to me for investment, but though I have lost it I cannot be
      prosecuted criminally&mdash;it was breach of trust. I hoped to get money
      to stave off exposure in the criminal matter so that I could set myself to
      earning more money and restoring what I owe to the investors. But I have
      not been able to raise that money. That&rsquo;s why I decided to kill myself. I
      knew I couldn&rsquo;t face it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you just find out that you couldn&rsquo;t raise the money, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at me, shame and agony in his face showing even in the dark.
      It began to swell in him&mdash;I could see it in his eyes&mdash;that
      longing which comes to every man in deep trouble&mdash;the wild hankering
      to confide in somebody&mdash;to rush into confession, to unload the heart,
      to speak the words which have been pressing to the lips. I was only Ross
      Sidney, to be sure, but I was a man and Judge Kingsley had been bottling
      his grief for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I did last was worst of all! Nobody could have convinced me that I
      would ever do such a piece of folly. Think of me doing such a thing&mdash;a
      man used to the ways of money! A financier! Oh, I have been dreading the
      scorn, the sneers, the ridicule more than I have dreaded the exposure of
      my town notes! I want to die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My investments were good in years past! I knew how to handle money&mdash;but
      what I did a few days ago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it, Judge?&rdquo; He had been hesitating between his declarations, and
      therefore I kept prodding him. But confession of his last affair seemed to
      stick in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am not guilty&mdash;I am not ashamed because I lost money in my
      investments! The pirates who have manipulated this country&rsquo;s industrials
      and wrecked the railroads are the guilty ones&mdash;they should be ashamed
      of what they did to the honest investors! But that I should run the scale
      of speculation as I have&mdash;to the depths! Down, down, as I got more
      desperate! And that I should do what I have just done when I was most
      desperate&mdash;when your uncle was rushing me toward a cell door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He twisted his fingers together and cracked his knuckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt like a man waiting for a woodchuck to come out of his hole&mdash;getting
      an occasional glimpse of a nose and seeing it everlastingly dodging back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I had to have money quick. I had lost my grip. I could not raise more
      money in a regular way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was in the city I heard swindlers talk about such men, sir. There
      are blacklegs who go about the country hunting for such men. Have you been
      swindled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foully&mdash;vilely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hooked his fingers inside his collar as if speech had stuck in his
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh!&rdquo; he advised me. He was as hoarse as a crow and looked as crazy as
      a coot. &ldquo;Go ahead and laugh! I may as well get used to the ridicule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel much like laughing at anything these days, Judge Kingsley. I
      wish that you could understand me better and know how sorry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and you and everybody else will pity me as a fool to be classed in
      with the other fools who are gulled by the shell-and-pea game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the sake of Mike, what have you done?&rdquo; I demanded with a bit of
      temper, for I was in no frame of mind to guess riddles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;Zebulon Kingsley&mdash;a financier, a man supposed to be in his
      right mind,&rdquo; he squealed, beating his breast as he struggled to his feet,
      &ldquo;I bought a gold brick!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XV&mdash;A TIP FROM MR. DAWLIN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HILE I blinked at
      Zebulon Kingsley through the gloom I remembered what &ldquo;Cricket&rdquo; Welch had
      once said to me, in one of those sessions where I lapped up information as
      greedily as a kitten laps milk. He had a flow of language, &ldquo;Cricket&rdquo; had,
      and I wish I could remember his words more accurately. But it was
      something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should any crook bring on brain-fag by thinking up new ones when the
      old ones, with gears smoothed by twenty-five centuries of steady
      operation, work so much better? As long ago as old Solomon was figuring on
      Temple estimates with the architects, and had quite a reputation in the
      country round about, a little chap dropped into a village outside of
      Babylon and gave out that he was The Old Boy&rsquo;s son by Wife 411, and was
      interested in King Solomon&rsquo;s mines along with his dad. Then he unloaded a
      gold brick on to a village sucker, first making the sucker believe that
      the latter was a buttonhole relation of the Solomon family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was running that speech over in my mind while I looked at the judge, a
      little uncertain what to say to him under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, the fraud did not seem to be barefaced while they were at work
      on me,&rdquo; lamented the old gentleman. &ldquo;One of them, the one who came to town
      first, was the son of one of my old schoolmates who went West when he was
      young and has been settled there ever since. Young Blake was East on
      business and dropped into Levant to look the old town over; his father
      told him to make himself known to me, so that he could carry back news of
      the folks his father used to know here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in my book of notes I had set down the detail of just such a scheme as
      that!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They always have a skirmisher ahead of the main push,&rdquo; I blurted. &ldquo;He
      finds out about somebody who settled West&mdash;and then along comes the
      son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded Kingsley. &ldquo;What do you know about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, after the son is well settled, along comes one of father&rsquo;s
      partners, East, to sell stock, and he has a sample of the clean-up&mdash;a
      big hunk of gold&mdash;and it&rsquo;s always a real ingot, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>was</i> real,&rdquo; insisted the judge, passionately. &ldquo;I went to the
      city and had it tested by a jeweler who is a friend of mine. They offered
      me a chance to make money on account of my old friendship. It did not seem
      like a gold-brick game. I could not believe it was. I did not dare to
      believe it was. I needed money so badly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mortgaged, I borrowed, I pawned! They offered me a chance to make money
      because I was a prominent man and could help them sell their stock. They
      wanted me to be sure that the proposition was a good one&mdash;that the
      gold was honest. They took my last five thousand dollars! My God! I bought
      a gold brick! I bought it like other fools have bought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They always put new trimmings on the old game, Judge Kingsley, and make
      it look attractive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me strangely and did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they worked it as usual,&rdquo; I went on, feeling just a bit proud
      of my knowledge. I reflected that he might be more thankful for his
      volunteer if I showed him that I was no greenhorn. His mouth had been
      running away with him in his wild eagerness to unload the sorrows from his
      soul. All at once he was showing symptoms of stiffening a bit, as if he
      wondered why he had opened his heart to such a one as Ross Sidney.
    </p>
    <p>
      I needed all his confidence&mdash;the flow was lessening&mdash;and so I
      &ldquo;shot the well,&rdquo; as the oil fellows say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After they had given you all kinds of nice entertainment in the city, you
      started for home and opened your package on the train and found a lead
      junk and a letter advising you to go home and keep still and never believe
      strangers again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That letter&mdash;that insult!&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They told you they were starting straight for Europe, and they&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is what you were in the city for, eh? A blackleg&mdash;one of
      them! Your brazen cheek&mdash;your flashy clothes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Judge Kingsley, I never tried to sell gold bricks. But it came my way
      to find out a lot about those fellows who do sell them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you flashy cheat!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;You are like that other one!
      Waistcoats like chromos! Tricked out with gewgaws&mdash;airs of a
      peacock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That last word sent a thrill through me, put an idea into my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he a big man, Judge Kingsley? Was his name Pratt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he brought the gold! He claimed to be the partner. He had a smear
      like grease across his cheek&mdash;a scar. He&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to know your confederates very well, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Kingsley, you listen to me! I have never seen those men face to
      face, but I have heard of them. I have heard of their tricks. I know how
      they operate. I know a good many of their lurking-places. I have made it
      my business to know!&rdquo; I noted that he was still suspicious, and I put my
      face close to his and lied with all the fervor that was in me. I needed
      his confidence, I say. &ldquo;I did work as a detective until the dirty mess of
      crooks made me sick of the job. I can help you in this thing! Depend on
      me! I&rsquo;m going to help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have about given up belief in everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your hand, sir, and promise me you&rsquo;ll offer a good front to the
      world. Nobody must guess that you&rsquo;re in difficulties. As for the noises my
      uncle is making, he has never said anything definite; he is merely making
      threats. Everybody knows about his grudge and folks don&rsquo;t take much stock
      in him. If you keep a stiff upper lip nobody will guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they all will <i>know</i> on the fifteenth of April.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we can grab in ten thousand dollars before then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you stand there, young man, and tell me you have the crazy idea that
      you can pull any of my money back from those scoundrels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and more with it,&rdquo; I returned, much more bold in my tone than I was
      in my heart. But when I knew that I had the &ldquo;Peacock&rdquo; Pratt gang
      identified&mdash;and probably had located Jeff Dawlin&rsquo;s brother as the man
      who planted the fraud, posing as the son, his usual rôle, certain wild
      hopes and dizzy schemes went to whirling in my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to have three thousand in cash in a short time to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A client&mdash;a widow is pressing me for money. It amounts to about that
      sum,&rdquo; he said, dolefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she suspect&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he snapped, irritably. &ldquo;She is going to be married again, the
      fool, and wants to hand it to her new husband.&rdquo; He showed a flicker of
      pride in the midst of his troubles. &ldquo;There is nobody calling Zebulon
      Kingsley a thief as yet, except himself and your uncle. <i>I</i> know that
      I am and <i>he</i> suspects,&rdquo; he added, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the woman must have her money, sir. We must keep everybody from even
      suspecting for a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took both his hands in mine. He did need comfort and sympathy, even such
      as I could offer him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m square with you, Judge Kingsley. I know how to find those men. I&rsquo;ll
      go after them. And I know you&rsquo;ll do your part to help me. I only ask you
      to buck up! Let nobody suspect!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to doubt every man in the world after what I have been through! I
      ought to doubt <i>you!</i> Why are you doing all this for me, sir?&rdquo; he
      demanded, and then I was glad it was dark there under the tree. I must
      have revealed confusion aplenty. &ldquo;I have never shown you any favors, young
      man. It has been the other way. I never liked your breed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, Judge Kingsley, but&mdash;&rdquo; I could not go any further at
      the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; I gulped, &ldquo;when I was a little shaver you gave me a quarter and
      I bought a catechism and studied it and&mdash;I guess&mdash;I&rsquo;m quite sure&mdash;it
      made a better boy, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It wasn&rsquo;t convincing, that talk wasn&rsquo;t! He caught me up sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth isn&rsquo;t in you, young Sidney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me that once before. And it has been my ambition to show you
      that you were wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! I know human nature too well to believe any such rot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you always stood up in Sunday-school, sir, and told us about
      Christian charity and meekness and forgiveness. You believe in all that,
      don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no confidence in you&mdash;not now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when I&rsquo;m trying to prove to you that I&rsquo;m one of those practical
      Christians?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not insult me with any more of that balderdash, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had just as much of nasty temper as he had, and mine began to flare up
      in me. I knew that my motives were all right, though I did not dare to
      reveal them to him&mdash;and my innocence made me the more angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have made a big hit with the good Samaritan when he came along
      and offered his help after you had fallen among thieves,&rdquo; I snapped. &ldquo;I
      reckon you have never practised any of the charity you have preached. I
      have never preached, but I am practising! You don&rsquo;t seem to recognize your
      own religion when you see it acted out instead of being merely printed in
      a book!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a renegade, convicting yourself out of your own mouth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, what was the use! I walked off a little way. Then I turned on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my own reasons for wanting to help you, Judge Kingsley, no matter
      what you believe about me. But if you feel as you talk, you can go to
      blazes just as soon as you like. I&rsquo;m not going to try to round up all the
      revolvers, ropes, and razors in this town. That rope you have there seems
      to be a good strong one. Go as far as you like! And I&rsquo;ll keep on in <i>my</i>
      way and will turn the money over to your estate&mdash;to your wife and
      your daughter. You are not the first coward who has knocked out the last
      prop and sluiced all the mess on to his women folks! Go on! I&rsquo;ll be
      furnishing your wife bread and butter while you&rsquo;re having insomnia in
      hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I went back to the tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew well enough that Zebulon Kingsley would not kill himself that
      night. In the first place, he was too mad. He came behind me, chattering
      his teeth like an angry squirrel. Then, again, I had stirred his
      curiosity, even if I had not given him any special hope. And my threat
      about handling his money after he had gone was enough to keep Zebulon
      Kingsley hanging around on top of the earth for a time. I knew his nature
      mighty well. I would have taken those means with him at first, but I had
      been hoping that he would accept me on a friendlier basis where I might
      coddle my hopes; and here was I handling him by the scruff of the neck!
    </p>
    <p>
      I caught a glimpse of Celene through the sitting-room window when I passed
      the house. The light was behind her and her hair was like an angel&rsquo;s halo.
      Ah! there was the inspiration which was keeping me on the lunatic&rsquo;s job I
      had picked out for myself! As for that old hornbeam father, I was in a
      state of fury which prompted me to go back, use his ears for handles, and
      kick him around his premises until he promised to behave himself&mdash;and
      give me his daughter when my task was finished. Well, at least I had
      reached one interesting stage in my development&mdash;I was acting as
      guardian of the high and mighty Zebulon Kingsley and was rather despising
      my ward!
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening I sat till late and went through my notebook and studied the
      affiliations, the methods, the lurking-places and all other information I
      had recorded in regard to one &ldquo;Peacock&rdquo; Pratt and his associates.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to me that I had a pretty good start on the thing, even though
      the future was, as Jodrey Vose used to say of dock water, in a &ldquo;nebulous
      and gummy condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I went to bed, nevertheless, in a considerably exalted state of mind.
      With every day that passed I was getting farther into the affairs of the
      Kingsley family&mdash;and getting into those affairs&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I dreamed of Celene that night, but that was not a matter for special
      record; I dreamed of her every night.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning I put on a business suit I had bought &ldquo;off the pile&rdquo; in
      Mechanicsville. I had wanted to show Levant that I had more than one suit
      of clothes. I reckoned that I would feel more sane and solid in that suit.
      And I did feel that way when I went down to breakfast. If ever a man had
      business ahead of him I was that one!
    </p>
    <p>
      But that sane and normal feeling did not sit well on my conscience. I
      found myself brooding and getting depressed. I wondered why I had felt so
      exalted and optimistic the night before. How could I have made such
      confident promises to Kingsley?
    </p>
    <p>
      While I sawed at that prosaic hunk o&rsquo; ham the notion of chasing up those
      knaves and getting my clutch on that stolen money&mdash;or any other money&mdash;seemed
      just a hopeless dream. It was surely a crazy idea; I sat there and looked
      down into my plate and so decided. For all of a quarter-hour I mulled and
      gloomed there, wondering what had happened to make me so dull and
      disheartened and doped. I woke up to what the matter was&mdash;woke all of
      a sudden. It was that blamed ready-made suit of clothes!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was simply plain Ross Sidney! I was right down on the plane of all the
      men around me. I looked like a tank-town commercial drummer and felt like
      one. I had no more imagination or horizon than a grocery clerk. All the
      fantastic spirit of adventure had gone out of me. Perhaps it may be
      thought that mere clothes cannot do all that to a man! Well, wear overalls
      to the next grand ball! I&rsquo;m no psychologist and I have never read
      Carlyle&rsquo;s essay on clothes, though I am told he describes about what I
      have felt. I&rsquo;m merely saying this: when I realized what was the matter
      with me and felt certain that I needed to be comfortably crazy in order to
      keep up my dip&mdash;why, do you suppose I would ever have tried to bark
      in front of that show if I had been dressed in a sack-suit?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, comfortably crazy!
    </p>
    <p>
      I rushed, up-stairs and shifted to my knight-errant regalia. Then I went
      to my job on the run. I reckoned that I was going to be in a devil of a
      hurry for a while!
    </p>
    <p>
      I galloped down to the wood-lot, my plug-hat riding tilted back like the
      funnel of a racing steamer. Those choppers were hearty and happy and were
      hustling for that bonus; if a few laggards needed pep I injected it. I
      made estimates, got every hitch in Levant which would cart wood and drag
      timber and started the cut for the railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The freight-trains picked up the gondola cars as they were ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rushed to the cities and arranged for deliveries, pulled down first
      payments in good season to settle wages for a week, as agreed with Henshaw
      Hook, and shuttled back and forth until all the cut was cleaned up on the
      lot. Gad! how I was counting days! I did not waste any time on Judge
      Kingsley. I realized that the more I kept away from him, the more I kept
      him guessing!
    </p>
    <p>
      I grabbed my first opportunity to take a day off the job and run down to
      the big city; I made that jump from one of the towns where I was handling
      the last deliveries&mdash;for I could not make final collections until the
      railroad completed its haul, and so I had a little time to spare.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another barker at the door of Dawlin&rsquo;s place, and I noted with
      gratification that he was a rather seedy chap. The blonde looked acutely
      surprised and showed apprehension when I walked right in past her.
      Plainly, her man had been making some promises as to what he would do to
      me if I ever showed up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the first glance Dawlin gave me when he looked up from his gazara
      envelopes showed that he was quite ready to keep his promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      I beckoned him to his office and walked in there and waited for him. He
      came on the jump. He was at me almost before I had time to place my
      plug-hat out of the way of possible damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Dawlin would close a gazara game right at a moment when suckers
      were shoving money at him, it was proof that he was specially interested
      in something else which was almighty important. His language when he burst
      in on me made it plain that his interest in me was not flattering, though
      it was intense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if it&rsquo;s that little, foolish, petty matter of the few dollars you
      handed back to those yaps,&rdquo; I broke in, after I had pushed him back with a
      swoop of my arm&mdash;and, as I have stated, it was a hard arm&mdash;&ldquo;here&rsquo;s
      your small change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In my wood business I had promptly changed checks into cash. I pulled out
      before the lustful eyes of Mr. Dawlin a roll of bills big enough to make a
      pillow for his Mormon Giant, and I carelessly flipped the edges to show
      him they were yellowbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did the little matter amount to?&rdquo; I asked, airily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six and twenty-two fifty&mdash;and I tossed &rsquo;em a five,&rdquo; he said,
      trying to make a quick shift from passion to pacification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I guess the drinks are on me this time, Jeff,&rdquo; I said, adding a
      ten-dollar bill to the amount. &ldquo;Go buy the kind you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This tells all the story,&rdquo; I said, tapping the roll and stuffing it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your partners&mdash;leaving me in the lurch&mdash;not inviting me in
      for a drag&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had to be a lone play, Jeff&mdash;just had to be! But don&rsquo;t think I
      have all the money in the world cornered in my pocket, even if it looks
      like it. And I&rsquo;m not back here simply to give you a treat by letting you
      look at it. I have located a bigger bundle&mdash;but it can&rsquo;t be coopered
      by a lone play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Job for the gang, hey?&rdquo; he asked, almost drooling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for the right operators if they&rsquo;re the real goods. But no amateurs,
      you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Condemn it! I have told you about my brother. He&rsquo;s one of the best in the
      country! Has just pulled off a killing&mdash;not very big, but easy and
      profitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing doing on the where!&rdquo; replied Mr. Dawlin, warily. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all done
      and the money counted. We always forget <i>where</i> as soon as the money
      is counted.&rdquo; He fingered his nose. &ldquo;Where is&mdash;&rdquo; he started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same tag,&rdquo; I said, smartly. &ldquo;You forget and I don&rsquo;t remember. All is,
      it&rsquo;s there waiting. Can we all get together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blast it all! you ought to know that we can&rsquo;t all get together to-day&mdash;nor
      a week from to-day!&rdquo; He showed some suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I know that?&rdquo; I looked him in the eye. &ldquo;When a job is done
      East, why, you know yourself they all shoot West&mdash;clear to the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me the last job was done East,&rdquo; I said, coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was. I can say that much. And they&rsquo;re on their way West&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      going over the Rockies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I guess I&rsquo;ll declare them out on the job, Jeff. I&rsquo;m in with some of
      the other&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s no way to use a friend like I&rsquo;ve been to you! This thing ought
      to be put up to Ike and &lsquo;Peacock.&rsquo; You must remember that I offered you a
      lay with them! I tried to use you right. You ought to show some
      gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was fairly whining in his anxiety, but I was mighty careful about
      showing any eagerness of my own. I scratched my ear and looked rather
      doubtful and displayed indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I can&rsquo;t write to &rsquo;em&mdash;we never write, especially
      soon after a job. But I have their bearings, Ross. I can put you right on
      to their trail. They have a job on below the Potlatch country in Idaho.
      First East and then West&mdash;get the idea? It&rsquo;s something about land&mdash;this
      operation. You&rsquo;re bound to bump into &rsquo;em; there are not so many men
      out there as there are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, it looks to me like a wild-goose chase,&rdquo; I demurred, hoping to be
      assured that it was no such thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Peacock&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t going to change his style! He&rsquo;s too far away to be
      obliged to bother&mdash;and he sure does like his togs! You can&rsquo;t hide
      &lsquo;Peacock&rsquo; Pratt if you surround him with a whole county. You&rsquo;ll find him
      easy, and my brother will be right on the wheel. Wait! If you don&rsquo;t know
      that country I&rsquo;ll jot down directions and names for you&mdash;names of men
      to ask. I&rsquo;ll give you a word or two for a passport!&rdquo; He grabbed paper and
      pen and began to scribble. &ldquo;What extra the trip costs will be added to
      your lay. You&rsquo;ll find them square if you get in with them,&rdquo; he assured me
      while he wrote. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to discuss any lay for me. My brother
      always sees to it that I get my pickings from any job I help him to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fairly thrust the paper into my hands when he had finished. Really, I
      was more grateful inside than I allowed to appear in my thanks. I could
      hardly ask Mr. Dawlin to do more in setting me on the trail of the men I
      was after. The humor of the thing certainly did appeal to me&mdash;and I
      needed a little something for cheer just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether I would try to pick their pockets when I arrived up with them, or
      knock them down with a dub, or what I would do I left to the future. I had
      enough to think of just then&mdash;that wood business to wind up and the
      matter of the future handling of Zebulon Kingsley to attend to&mdash;and a
      crazy chase across the continent ahead of me!
    </p>
    <p>
      I tucked the paper deep, slapped Mr. Dawlin on the back, and hustled for
      up-country.

    <h2>
      XVI&mdash;GRABBING A HUSBAND AND FATHER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN I laid rising
      three thousand dollars in front of Zebulon Kingsley on his office table as
      my card of reintroduction to that glum gentleman, I really jumped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The money was in bills and there was a stack of it. A mere check would not
      have been half as impressive. A lot of men in this world are extravagant
      because they pay by check; handling real money makes one more appreciative
      of values, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have wound up the wood-lot proposition to the last cent,&rdquo; I informed
      him. &ldquo;All collections made, all the men paid, and I hope you are as well
      satisfied as the rest. There&rsquo;s the cash!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much is there?&rdquo; His voice trembled when he asked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your word, and later&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have told-me several times that the truth isn&rsquo;t in me. Count that
      money! I insist!&rdquo; A bit nasty of me, I admit, but I had resolved to make
      my bigness, where Judge Kingsley was concerned. I saw no chance of winning
      unless I made him understand that I was not to be kicked around any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood over him while he counted. His bony fingers shook. Even though he
      was handling money&mdash;rather a favorite indoor sport of his&mdash;I
      knew he was finding the job a bitter one, with me at his elbow and acting
      just as if I belonged there. He jotted down amounts as he counted, and
      then he added the figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make it three thousand three hundred and fifty four dollars and
      twenty-nine cents,&rdquo; he reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, sir.&rdquo; I held my little account-book in front of his nose
      and tapped my totals. &ldquo;I did a bit better than I figured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two thousand which belongs to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no divisions in that pile, sir. We are not going to have any
      such argument as we had once before about price and land and deed. You
      need that money for immediate use and you&rsquo;re going to take it. And don&rsquo;t
      tell me again that you don&rsquo;t need my help. You do!&rdquo; Big talk, but he
      needed it! &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you be afraid that I shall ever twit you about this
      help. Now is there any way of staving off this widow who wants her three
      thousand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I have promised her. After what you told me&mdash;I reckoned on&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Then you have been admitting to yourself the last few days that I&rsquo;m
      not so much of a renegade and crook, after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes shifted. &ldquo;You must make allowances in my case, Mr. Sidney!&rdquo; That
      looked promising. He was giving me a handle for my name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll pay the widow so that she will not be wagging her jaw while
      we&rsquo;re away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While we&rsquo;re away?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir! You and I are going to start on the trail of that last batch of
      money you invested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll never get money that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How else are you going to raise ten thousand dollars before the fifteenth
      of April?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no way of raising it!&rdquo; he lamented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! No sensible, business way! Therefore, we must do the next best&mdash;grab
      from the men who have grabbed from you. It&rsquo;s either that or go steal
      money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I pulled up to the table and before his eyes counted back to myself the
      money over and above three thousand dollars. I put it in my pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our common purse&mdash;for traveling expenses,&rdquo; I explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a long journey, sir. However, I must go and you must go along
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in condition to travel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, sir, and I&rsquo;m sorry. I wish I did not need you on the job,
      but you must be with me in order to identify those men who robbed you.
      Your complaint will put them in the jug if we can&rsquo;t scare them and twist
      the money out of them in another way. I can&rsquo;t do a thing without your
      presence, unless I catch up with them and knock them down. I may just as
      well stay East here and commit highway robbery for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had another reason for insisting on his making the trip with me, but I
      kept it to myself. If I left him behind there in Levant with my
      rambunctious uncle barking at his heels and creditors waking up to
      suspicions, I could not have one moment&rsquo;s peace of mind. I felt pretty
      sure that he would betray himself by face, his actions, or by suicide or
      confession. He was in no shape to endure inquisition if he were left where
      folks could get at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go,&rdquo; I insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more or less of a blind run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re only wasting time by talking it over ahead, Judge Kingsley, because
      I don&rsquo;t know much about the trip myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to show temper, and I could not blame him much. My comfortable
      craziness which I had put on along with my &ldquo;dream suit&rdquo; was helping a lot;
      the judge was frostily sane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The project is crazy,&rdquo; he stormed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So is the fix you&rsquo;re in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell my wife and daughter nothing sensible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As near as I can find out, sir, you have never told them anything special
      about your business. Why begin now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they are worried. My actions&mdash;those strangers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, sir. They told me. But when you go away this time you&rsquo;ll be going
      in my company and that may help with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave me a look which hinted that he was not at all sure about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been in one business deal; it&rsquo;s easy to say we&rsquo;re in another,&rdquo; I
      suggested, choosing to overlook his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my feelings got away from me when he began to protest and argue and
      ask questions about why and where and when. The balky old mule! And I was
      giving him my soul and service free!
    </p>
    <p>
      I pounded my knuckles on the heaped money. &ldquo;We are going to leave this
      town on the night train, Judge Kingsley. That gives you time enough to
      settle with the widow and tell your folks something and get them calmed
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to browbeat me, young man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and you&rsquo;ll have time to think the thing over for yourself, sir,
      before I call for you with a hitch just before train-time! There will be
      no arguments then. I shall expect you to be all ready with your bag in
      hand. Go light on luggage. We shall go a long way and we shall go in a
      hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I left him and went about a few final affairs of my own, and when I
      finished I was squared with everybody in Levant. Before handing that money
      to the judge I had paid my personal debts&mdash;I felt that I was entitled
      to that much!
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Dodovah Vose loaned me a hitch and a driver and clapped me on
      the shoulder with great zest and pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the judge picked you for a partner he picked the right one,&rdquo; he
      declared. &ldquo;You make a team which will bring this old town up on its feet.
      The judge needs you, son. He has been going behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then once more he tried to pump me regarding this latest venture, for
      I had purposely dropped a word to him that the judge and I were off on a
      big deal. I knew that a seed planted in Dodovah Vose would bring forth
      fruit of the sort the judge and I needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can just hint to folks, if you feel like it, Mr. Vose, that Judge
      Kingsley and I have seen a way to help this town very much.&rdquo; That was
      true. &ldquo;Incidentally, the judge will make a great deal of money out of
      certain things where his capital has been tied up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always said he knew his business as a financier. Some of the old
      tom-cats in this town have been prowling and meraouwing because he has
      been tied up lately by mortgages; but you&rsquo;ve got to bait with money to
      catch money! Don&rsquo;t fret, son. I&rsquo;ll hand &rsquo;em out something now to
      warm their ear-wax.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he knows how to make money for himself and for other folks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I too late to slip in a few hundred on this deal?&rdquo; asked Mr. Vose,
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was promptly on my tongue, of course, to put him aside as gently as
      possible. But I knew that he had been wondering why I had not let him in
      on the thing before, for truly he had been my best friend in that town. I
      had no good excuse to give him. I needed his friendship and his loyal good
      word even more then than in the past, for suspicion was darkly brooding in
      Levant. I hated to leave behind with him the impression that I would do
      everything for Zebulon Kingsley, who had been my foe, and would not turn
      even a little leak of prosperity into an old friend&rsquo;s porringer.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was struggling with my thoughts&mdash;feeling like a scoundrel
      reaching for his brother&rsquo;s wallet&mdash;a strange notion came to me. It
      fitted in with that comfortable craziness of mine. If I accepted his
      money, would I not be pledging my very soul to do and to dare? My devotion
      to Celene Kingsley I had set at one side as my true and sacred motive. I
      was mighty sure that I was not at all enthusiastic in regard to her
      father. However, if I took Dodovah Vose&rsquo;s hard-earned money from his hands&mdash;and
      taking it meant a pledge that he was to benefit from a sure thing&mdash;had
      I not another sacred and even more compelling motive? Truly I had, for my
      man&rsquo;s honor was concerned as well as my love for a girl!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you handy?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I ask no questions. I want no promises. I know
      you&rsquo;ll do your best for me, son. I hate to bother you&mdash;but profits
      come slow in a country tavern, and I&rsquo;d like to do a little extra repairing
      this spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was on his way to his rusty old safe while he talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I took his money and went away from him with the warmth of his palm on
      mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grinding of the wagon-wheels on the grit in front of Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s
      house brought Celene to the door, and when I did not climb down from the
      wagon she called to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not come into the house?&rdquo; she pleaded. I had not intended to do
      so. In spite of my longing to see her and to have her parting smile go
      along with me on that amazing journey I was undertaking, I had made up my
      mind to duck judiciously a meeting-up with the women folks of my traveling
      partner. But I had no will to disobey when she called to me. I found the
      judge with his overcoat on and his bag in his hand. Evidently he had
      thought the matter over! But he did not look like a bridegroom starting on
      a honeymoon trip, and he scowled at me with as much ferocity as if we were
      two tom-cats tied by the tails over a clothes-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife was hanging to his arm and she was white, even to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sidney, I must know what this mysterious business is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the judge will tell you what is necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will tell me nothing. I have endured much in the past, Zebulon! I have
      not asked to know much about your affairs,&rdquo; she went on, trying to get a
      square look into his eyes. &ldquo;This time I <i>must</i> know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you!&rdquo; From his tone it was hard to tell what his emotions
      were. The words sounded as if somebody were talking into a tin spout a
      long way off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have told me nothing except that you are going! You do not say where.
      You have not told me when you are coming back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t exactly know, Mrs. Kingsley. But I assure you that the trip is
      very necessary,&rdquo; I put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must tell you that mother is not well,&rdquo; said Celene, wistfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      sure everything is all right, but we must know where you are going so that
      we may be in touch with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can keep you posted&mdash;when we know where we are,&rdquo; I said; but I
      did not sound very convincing, I fear. God knows, I wanted to put my arms
      around her and comfort her and tell her that I was madly trying to save
      her, her home, her mother, and her father from disgrace and ruin. I guess
      no man has ever figured out beyond doubt whether it&rsquo;s better to tell the
      woman everything or to hide trouble as long as possible. When women are
      proud they never forget the disgrace, whether it is revealed outside or if
      it&rsquo;s merely kept secret in the household. And in Zebulon Kingsley&rsquo;s case I
      was proposing to keep the effect of the disgrace as well as all knowledge
      of it away from those women.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew how he felt in the matter! He had chosen revolvers and ropes rather
      than face them. I was determined to be just as resolute as he&mdash;until
      a show-down was inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be a sorry triumph, a half job, if they were obliged to live out
      their lives knowing that the master of the household had lived for years
      in the shadow of prison; it meant the wrecking of all their pride and
      ideals&mdash;no more joy in home or life itself in the case of such women
      as they. I understood!
    </p>
    <p>
      The big dock was ticking off minutes rapidly. Our time was short. I
      shuffled my feet, impatiently wishing that Judge Kingsley would hurry up.
      His woe-begone, frozen face was making the thing worse every minute he
      stayed there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is mystery here,&rdquo; insisted his wife. &ldquo;There should be no mystery
      about business that&rsquo;s honest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surely can tell us something to comfort us before you go,&rdquo; urged
      Celene, coming dose to me, pleading with her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I knew I must stay away from the edges of explanation in her presence;
      once I got started, I&rsquo;d be sure to tumble into a mess. I looked over her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must hurry, Judge!&rdquo; I warned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that my husband would never go into any business that isn&rsquo;t
      honest,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Kingsley, beginning to show temper. She faced me
      and her eyes glittered. &ldquo;But he is growing old, and his judgment may not
      be what it was. There are always men trying to lead others into trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; I admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive mother if she says anything harsh! But we are in such a state of
      mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, so was I!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have mortgaged the home over my head,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Kingsley. &ldquo;I have
      given the money to my husband willingly&mdash;but I will not allow thieves
      to waste it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was about time for me to assert myself a little. The judge was merely
      working his mouth like a dying fish, and it was plain that he could be no
      help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame your mother,&rdquo; I told the girl. I took her hands in mine,
      glad I could carry away the memory of her touch. &ldquo;Some of those men who
      have been hanging around the judge are not good men, but I was born in
      this town and you know me! I&rsquo;m helping your father in an important matter.
      I swear I&rsquo;m telling the truth. And I&rsquo;ll bring him back safe and sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I left her before I should be tempted to kiss her right before their eyes,
      and I took the judge&rsquo;s bag in one hand and boosted him along with a clutch
      on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We simply must catch that train!&rdquo; I urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sad scene for a few moments. I was obliged fairly to tussle with
      that woman for the possession of the old man. But I ran him out and left
      the mother sobbing in the daughter&rsquo;s arms, and they were in the doorway
      when I helped the judge into the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brace up!&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;Give &rsquo;em just a word or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he quavered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only business! It must be attended to.
      There&rsquo;s nothing to fret about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wasn&rsquo;t, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lick up!&rdquo; I told the driver. &ldquo;Lay on the braid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went rattling out of Levant behind a galloping horse and I liked the
      sensation of that haste. We were chasing ten thousand dollars and had less
      than twenty days for the job.

      XVII&mdash;MONEY HAS LEGS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E swapped not a
      word on the way to the railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge seemed to be settled down into a sort of numb condition, and I
      was glad of it, for I did not feel like talking. He stood indifferently at
      one side when I bought tickets, and I was glad of that also. If I was to
      be purser and general manager of that expedition I did not want to have a
      joint debate every time I made a move.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first tickets took us to a junction point. Then I bought to Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge went along silently, showing about as much interest as a mummy
      in me, or in the scenery or people. I suppose the old fellow was having a
      terrible struggle with his fears, his thoughts, and his recollection of
      the manner in which he had parted from his family. I sympathized with him
      and left him alone. Once in a while I got a side-glance from him which
      suggested that he had not abandoned his distrust of me. Perhaps he
      pondered that he was simply submitting to another form of self-destruction
      and was willing to let it go at that!
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;ll confess this: I was taking so much interest in the world about me
      that I was finding it hard to concentrate my thoughts on the business we
      had in hand. I had done no railroad-riding to speak of till then. It
      seemed as unreal as if I were headed for the moon instead of into the far
      vastness of my native land. When we went rolling through the smoky fringes
      of Chicago and I saw that there really was a Chicago, my emotion, as I
      remember it, was astonishment. But I had already found out that a
      greenhorn could get along pretty well by watching other folks and by
      asking questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we crowded into the transfer-wagon on Polk Street and were quickly
      across the city to another railroad station, where I bought tickets for
      St. Paul. Before the train pulled out I raided a folder-stand and grabbed
      a sample of everything in the rack.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went into those folders like a girl diving into the love scenes in a
      mush novel; I studied as diligently as if I were a prize pupil getting
      ready for a contest. I had my nose in those papers for hours, till I could
      close my eyes and see maps and repeat time-tables and names of cities
      backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I wasn&rsquo;t at a loss when we reached St. Paul. I trotted the judge right
      along to a window and bought tickets for Spokane. He was mumbling a
      monotone of growls in my ear while I counted out the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, young man,&rdquo; he said, when we had left the window, &ldquo;I am not
      going to be teamed any farther until you tell me exactly where you are
      going and what you are intending to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It rather surprised me to hear him speak; I had sort of forgotten that he
      could talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you pretend that you expect to get money, racing around like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the trail of it, Judge Kingsley&mdash;your money, you remember.
      I&rsquo;m not doing this for my own amusement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be; I&rsquo;ve been watching you, sir. You are plainly relishing
      this junketing about. I go no farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much money have you in your pocket?&rdquo; I asked, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked alarmed. &ldquo;I did not bring money! You took the money for
      expenses, you said. I depended on that. I have only a few dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;So there&rsquo;s no chance for argument here on this
      platform.&rdquo; I waved the tickets under his nose. &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;ll have to
      stick right along with me, sir, wherever I go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That settled that rebellion!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I started toward the train he followed. His face was white, his jaws
      were ridged, and he was furious&mdash;but his anger locked his lips. He
      did not bother me with questions. That night I hid my money inside my
      berth-pillow; by the way the judge looked at me I knew he would pick my
      pocket if he got a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      On we went across the prairies of the Dakotas&mdash;and the journey was
      not interesting. It was all dun and dull and brown and monotonous in that
      late March. When the sun shone it only showed up more of the raw country.
      Every little while we went plunging through a snow-squall which plastered
      the car windows and speckled the brown of the prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the doldrums got me! All at once I found myself bluer than the old
      judge had been, even in his deepest despondency. This was a reckless
      escapade, not a sensible man&rsquo;s project! I had bragged and blustered and
      made promises there in that little tin dipper of a Levant where the
      horizon was pinched in by Mitchell&rsquo;s Mountain and Tumbledick Hill. I had
      got by with my bluff in the wood-lot game and had felt as if I were a big
      man!
    </p>
    <p>
      But out there!
    </p>
    <p>
      No longer was it a string of mere names and a smudge of color on paper to
      make a map! I was looking out, hour by hour, on the reality of the
      vastness of the great West. As to the men I was hunting for in that wide
      expanse&mdash;those fly-by-nighters, those human skip-bugs&mdash;would
      they not be dodging where impulse took them? Jeff Dawlin was a mere
      gambler&mdash;willing to take a chance on anything. Had he not taken a
      mere gambler&rsquo;s chance on my finding those men? If I succeeded he would get
      his pay. If I did not succeed it was only <i>my</i> failure&mdash;he had
      invested nothing&mdash;he had no interest in my affairs, except a
      gambler&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what could I do to those men if I did find them? They were at home out
      there&mdash;as much at home as they were in the East. The farther out on
      those prairies I rolled, the farther away from all confidence in myself I
      seemed to be. Old Ariock Blake used to say that sometimes he felt as if he
      were &ldquo;forty miles from water and a hundred miles from land.&rdquo; I felt just
      as helplessly up in the air as that! I fairly wallowed in sloppy gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      To sit there in front of Zebulon Kingsley in my state of mind and courage
      and look on his gad-awful sourness of visage was too much for my nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to get a drink of water and heard men laughing in the smoking-room.
      If there were men in the world who could laugh I wanted to be with them.
      So I went in. They were playing poker, and after a time one man had to
      leave the train and they asked me into the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was desperate enough to grab at anything that would take my mind off my
      troubles, so I began to play poker. And when a man sits in to play poker
      with strangers it&rsquo;s a mighty small slice of mind he has left to blotter
      worry with.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was away from the judge a long time, and he came hunting me up and
      caught me at the pastime. Perhaps he feared that his two-legged bank had
      fallen off the train and he had been worrying; but when he saw me with
      cards in my hand and money spread out he had a lot more to worry about and
      his face showed it. He let out of him a sort of moan and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father?&rdquo; asked one of the men, casually. &ldquo;Sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I mean he&rsquo;s sick, but he&rsquo;s not my father. He is a big
      Eastern capitalist I&rsquo;m escorting West on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put me next&mdash;I can offer him some great chances,&rdquo; said another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he is feeling too bad to talk business&mdash;and he is very
      notional in the matter of strangers. Don&rsquo;t say anything to him; leave it
      to me.&rdquo; I was obliged to say something about the judge and to block them
      from bothering him, if I could, for I knew he would not be contented with
      one inspection of me at my devilish and dangerous occupation. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pay
      any attention to his actions,&rdquo; I advised. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s feeling mighty sick&mdash;a
      long ride makes him sort of seasick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was glad I had planted something with the men, for the judge kept coming
      and sticking his head between the curtains and making strange noises. He
      went at me in good earnest when he had me at table in the dining-car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you throw away my money on gamblers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done so, Judge Kingsley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you doing it in that dirty den of smoke and vice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw me playing cards, I&rsquo;ll admit. I had to do something to keep from
      going crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tossing away my money! Gambling my dollars&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment, sir! That money is a part of my profits and I consider it
      a common pot for both of us. I know how to play poker. I have added
      forty-five dollars to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you boast that you have been cheating at cards to help <i>me?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Confound him! he could sting a man with that tongue of his!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man can play poker without cheating. Just as a man can do business
      without cheating!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked him in the eye and he shut up. I had found out that I could get
      along with him better when he didn&rsquo;t talk. After the meal I went back to
      the game. I felt that every little helped, provided I could hold my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      I couldn&rsquo;t resist a quiet chuckle inside when I reflected that I was
      industriously playing cards for the benefit of Judge Zebulon Kingsley,
      Sunday-school superintendent of Levant.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had learned long before how to watch out in a card game, and when I felt
      little scratches on the backs of the cards and observed that one of the
      players was doing the gouge act with a specially manicured finger-nail, I
      turned a few tricks of my own. I felt the full humor of the thing when I
      calmed my conscience with the thought that it was all for the sake of the
      judge. When he came to the curtains and glared at me I grinned at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cleaned up one hundred and fifteen dollars, at any rate, before we
      rolled into Spokane&mdash;and I had at least five hundred dollars&rsquo; worth
      of respite from my bitter misgivings. When I showed that tainted money to
      the judge with some little pride and impelled by a spirit of devilishness
      I couldn&rsquo;t control, I thought for a moment that he would bite me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to associate any longer with a scalawag. I&rsquo;m not going to
      be bullyragged by a scoundrel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, when we&rsquo;re roaming we&rsquo;ve got to do as the roamers do,&rdquo; I told
      him. Deep in me I was ashamed of the disrespect I was showing him by
      plaguing him in that fashion, but I felt an almost irresistible hankering
      to do it; he had so long lorded it in Levant. Furthermore, he did not seem
      to recognize in any manner my spirit of self-sacrifice; he had not shown
      to me one flash of wholehearted gratitude. I may have had a cloudy notion
      that he needed to have his spirit of Kingsley pride humbled before he
      would ever consider me as a likely son-in-law. My ideas then and the
      memories of my ideas now are not very clear, for I was not in any very
      calm and philosophic mood those days.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a carriage had snatched us across Spokane and we were landed on the
      platform of a station from which trains for the Idaho country departed, he
      did buck in good earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man of plan and method; he had passed his life in routine. That
      rattle-brained gallop must have offended every instinct in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not get on that train. I&rsquo;ll go no farther. I&rsquo;ll appeal to the
      police,&rdquo; he raved. &ldquo;Give me my share of that money and I&rsquo;ll go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have mixed it all together&mdash;gambling money and all! I would not
      have you traveling on gambling money, Judge.&rdquo; My pertness added to his
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you arrested, so help me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on before you put the binding word to that oath, Judge Kingsley. If
      you dare to put me in the jug away out here away from home, I&rsquo;ll yank you
      in as an embezzler of town money&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve got an uncle who is first
      selectman of the town! A little telegraphing will do the trick. Now let&rsquo;s
      both of us throw away our bombs. The fuses are sizzling! Climb aboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ground his teeth and climbed!
    </p>
    <p>
      A fine sort of a brindled, cross-eyed hen was I setting to hatch my
      son-in-law hopes! But a mood of recklessness was sweeping me then.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not buy tickets; I paid cash fares to the conductor, naming a
      station I culled from the folder. I was not sure what the limits of the
      Potlatch country were; I proposed to drop in with somebody on the train,
      if I could manage it discreetly, and post myself by asking questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw no likely subjects in the car where we were riding&mdash;the
      passengers were mostly women&mdash;so I slicked up my silk hat, fixed it
      at a confident and compelling angle, and went out into the smoking-car.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have just said, the spirit of recklessness was flaming in me. I did
      not dare to let it die down. I lashed my courage and my craziness both
      together. I was bitterly afraid I might drop back into that paralyzing
      despondency I had felt back there on the Dakota prairies. That meant that
      I would become a useless quitter. Only by dint of holding myself in that
      desperate mood where I proposed to let chance have its way with me, and to
      grab in on anything that offered, would I have gone through so brazenly
      with the affair on which I soon found myself entering. It was merely
      another gamble, it seemed to me after I was in it. It was taking my mind
      off my more private affairs, even as the poker game had distracted my
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      I marched through to the front of the smoking-car where the train-boy was
      arranging his little stock, bought a paper, and walked slowly back up the
      aisle with a glance to right and left at the faces of the men, hoping to
      get a rise from that &ldquo;likely subject&rdquo; I was hunting for.
    </p>
    <p>
      One man returned my glance with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I sat down, well up in the car, I looked over the top of the
      newspaper and saw that the stranger&rsquo;s interest in me continued. The chap
      had a broad face, liquor-mottled. After a while he unscrewed the top of a
      flask and sucked in a long drink. Then he worked his shoulders, jerked at
      the bottom of his waistcoat, wriggled his arms, and displayed other
      symptoms of a man who is trying to brace up and to pull himself together.
      At last he derricked himself out of his seat and swayed up the car aisle.
      He divided glances between my plug-hat and the frock-coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, but it&rsquo;s the clothes,&rdquo; said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t butt in and speak to you if it wasn&rsquo;t for the clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more I was having it impressed on me that a plug-hat and a frock-coat
      seemed to be good reliable openers in the jack-pot of chance. I reckoned
      I&rsquo;d play the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a parson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m far from it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The farthest from it I know is to be a lawyer. I spotted you for a
      lawyer. If you are one I want to talk with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a lawyer. Sit down,&rdquo; was my cheerful lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger hauled out his flask. &ldquo;Do you ever indulge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better. Lawyers ought to keep their brains cool. Seeing that
      you&rsquo;ve got the brains and propose to keep &rsquo;em cool, I&rsquo;ve got to
      keep up my nerve&mdash;and so I&rsquo;ll take a drink.&rdquo; He sucked at the flask
      again. &ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the East.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know this country and the laws out in this section,&rdquo; said
      the stranger, showing his disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I do; I used to live out here. That&rsquo;s why I happen to be here
      now. I&rsquo;m investigating investments for Eastern capital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My new acquaintance leaned dose, so close that his whisky-saturated breath
      left vapor on my cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found out something that&rsquo;s big. I thought I could handle it
      myself. I have started out to handle it myself. But when I saw you I said
      to myself, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a squire, and he knows law and probably his brains are
      cooler than mine.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve got the secret and I&rsquo;ve got the grit, but I need
      law, too&mdash;and I ain&rsquo;t sure of all the fine points. I want you to come
      along with me and stand at my back and hand me the fine points as I need
      &rsquo;em. What do you charge per day for peddling law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to know what the deal is first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was getting a little shaky on the proposition and raised the paper in
      front of my face and appeared to lose interest in matters of law. After a
      time the red-faced individual tapped on the paper with his knuckle, as one
      would tap on a door. I pulled my shield to one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A chap hates to let go of a big thing to a stranger, even if that
      stranger is a lawyer. I have walked past a dozen law-offices without
      daring to go in. Perhaps you don&rsquo;t realize what a big thing I&rsquo;ve got. Now
      listen here! Suppose you were a fellow like I am&mdash;a prospector&mdash;and
      was digging around the record-books, looking up land titles, mineral
      grants, and so forth, and got on to a trail that you followed up and found
      that a new city had been laid out and lots sold off and buildings going
      up, and all that&mdash;all on a location that wasn&rsquo;t legal? Mind you, I
      ain&rsquo;t naming any place. But it&rsquo;s on a section that land-grabbers got hold
      of a long time ago. And they were such hungry land-grabbers that they
      stretched lines to take in everything that was loose around those parts.
      There was no one to make any holler about it. It was just so much extra
      land and it didn&rsquo;t look like real money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have so much business of my own that I&rsquo;m not interested in making
      guesses at the business of somebody else,&rdquo; I remarked. I was in that thing
      about as deep as I wanted to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how do I know anything about you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honors are even!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger knuckled his forehead, trying to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to trig the best thing I ever got hold of in my life because
      I didn&rsquo;t buy a little law for to grease the runway,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I
      may as well tell you&mdash;without giving out names and places&mdash;that
      those land-grabbers hooked in a section that belonged to a soldiers&rsquo; grant&mdash;and
      that&rsquo;s why no one ever made a holler. There don&rsquo;t seem to be any
      particular heirs to side-tracked soldiers&rsquo; grants that have never been
      thought worth much. No timber, you see; only plain land. But plain land is
      mighty good property when a railroad takes a notion to build on to it and
      comes to an end there and a city starts.&rdquo; The client began to show
      excitement. &ldquo;They have laid out lots and built and they haven&rsquo;t got
      straight title. I have found it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t seem reasonable,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Railroads and men who are
      building cities do not make such mistakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they have this time. The same money that grabbed the land has built
      the railroad. They think they have got it all buttoned up. They didn&rsquo;t
      want to expose themselves by starting a movement to make their title
      straight. They reckon they&rsquo;ll be able to bluff it out with money and pull
      and influence down to Boise. That will be easier than to chase around and
      establish title to a soldiers&rsquo; grant. But, by thunder! they can&rsquo;t stretch
      or shrink the hide of old earth! There are set points that have got to be
      measured from and the measurements will tell the story. And re-locations
      will have to stand&mdash;for the law of the United States can&rsquo;t be built
      over when the holler is made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I guess I didn&rsquo;t show much interest&mdash;I was afraid to show any. I
      hoped the man would shut up and go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe what I am telling you?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am merely wondering how it comes about that you know so much, more than
      everybody else about a section of land that has been surveyed for a
      railroad and a new city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father was a pioneer in this country. One day, after they began to
      build the railroad, I was in the record-office and happened to remember
      some of the things he told me about the days when they were grabbing land
      in these parts. I looked up records, I did measuring, I did some
      reckoning, and within the last two days I have made sure that I&rsquo;ve got the
      bind on the city of Breed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his excitement he spat out the name. Then he promptly began to damn
      himself. &ldquo;I never ought to take a drink of liquor,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;But when
      it came to me that I could run in there and re-locate the best hunk of
      that land, I reckoned I needed to have my nerve with me, and so I&rsquo;ve been
      bracing my nerve. But the trouble with me is, when my nerve is braced my
      tongue is loose. Now I suppose I&rsquo;ve got to take you in! But I&rsquo;m dangerous.
      However, I&rsquo;ll take you in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t say anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you get a day for your best law work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t work by the day.&rdquo; I wondered just how lawyers did work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, name your price for standing by me against the sharks they&rsquo;ll
      bring to try to beat me out. I don&rsquo;t know anything about hiring lawyers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take half.&rdquo; I thought that remark would send him hipering away.
    </p>
    <p>
      My client&rsquo;s face promptly showed the color of a ripe damson. He tried to
      say something and merely clucked. After a struggle he managed to control
      his temper and his voice. He leaned forward and clutched my knees. He
      spoke low, for there were other passengers near, but the rasp in his tones
      made up for any lack of emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Peter Dragg. If you have never heard of me, ask somebody about
      me. Ask any one between Buffalo Hump and Cour d&rsquo;Alene. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of
      practice in doing things to men who have got in my way. What I&rsquo;ll do to
      you if you don&rsquo;t back up will put red rings around the moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, consider I&rsquo;m discharged!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From my position as your lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t hired you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then suppose you cast off those grappling-hooks,&rdquo; I suggested, for his
      clutch on my knees hurt my flesh and my feelings. When he did not let go,
      I reached down slowly, grabbed his hands and began to pry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a man about us noticed what was going on&mdash;the newspaper that I
      had dropped covered our hands. It was tense and silent testing out which
      was the better man in that clinch. He had a handsome little grip of his
      own, I&rsquo;ll admit, but I had diver&rsquo;s hooks at the ends of my arms and I
      bested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quit!&rdquo; he growled, after a time. &ldquo;Leave go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>did</i> lie, but not now. You pass on about your business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t my own business any longer&mdash;I have put you wise to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m forgetting it. I have plenty else on my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get past with that kind of bluff,&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;You intend to
      beat me to it, but you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, I&rsquo;m coming across square with you,&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;You came and
      jammed a lot of information on to me. I didn&rsquo;t ask for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say you coaxed it out of me. Now you&rsquo;ve got to come in and give me law
      on a decent lay. If you don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll do you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a <i>lawyer</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know better! You&rsquo;re tied up with me&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got to stick to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have important matters which will take all my time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your time from now on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here! I propose to go on and mind my own business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re spoken for! I&rsquo;ll tend to you before you get a chance to butt
      in on <i>my</i> business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned back in his seat and pushed his coat aside, inviting my
      attention by a downward glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was packing a gun on each hip&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you about ten minutes&rsquo; recess to think the thing over,&rdquo; he
      stated. &ldquo;If you try to leave this train I&rsquo;ll be after you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went down the car, turned over a scat, and faced me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in a fine way to attend to the business of Judge Kingsley and
      myself! Whether I went into that fellow&rsquo;s scheme or did not go in, it
      seemed all the same. In those days, according to what I had read, they
      were very careless about handling firearms in some parts of the West, and
      it looked to me as if I had dropped into one of those sections. He took
      another pull from his flask. The uncertainty of what that intoxicated
      gentleman might feel impelled to do to me next, in the confusion of his
      fuddlement, made the shivers run up and down my back. In the ten anxious
      minutes that passed he pulled that flask four times, and every time he
      reached for it I made a motion to dodge under the seat. The damnable part
      of it was that nobody in the car was paying the least attention to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he came tottering up the aisle and lurched into the seat in front of
      me. Between two hiccups he sandwiched a threatening, &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Plainly, he
      was well &ldquo;pickled&rdquo; and accordingly dangerous. And, on the other hand,
      there was a hope for me in his condition. I concluded I might as well be
      shot as scared to death. I couldn&rsquo;t draw a deep breath as long as those
      guns were on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what say?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; I mumbled. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s make it private. Listen! I&rsquo;ll
      whisper!&rdquo; I leaned forward, sliding both hands along his legs, getting
      close to his ear. I laid hands on both weapons and jerked myself back,
      holding them low at my hips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make one move and I&rsquo;ll bore you,&rdquo; I growled. &ldquo;Go back to your seat. Go
      quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went. I tucked the guns into my own pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      We passed the station to which I had paid fares, and I handed more money
      to the conductor. I decided to stay on the train, hoping that my client
      would arrive at his home town, whatever it was, and get off. But he kept
      right on.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time he held up a handkerchief by one corner and waggled it,
      giving me a drunken and moist wink. Evidently he wanted further conference
      under a flag of truce, and I nodded agreement after I had made sure that
      the guns could be come at easily. I agreed because I hoped I could make
      some sensible arrangement to get rid of this particular bottle imp who had
      landed himself on to my affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re a slick one, eh?&rdquo; My hopes fell, for his tone did not
      suggest compromise. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better turn around and go back. You&rsquo;re heading
      into the wrong country. Will you go back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought you said you used to live out this way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, what is the country you&rsquo;re speaking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Potlatch section,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not get as far as that.
      You know Shan Benson, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Ive Hacker, Binn Mingo, Cole Wass&mdash;all friends of mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pals, I say! All work together. Pull off our plays together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead!&rdquo; he repeated, grinding his teeth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go ahead and make a
      pot roast of you in that plug-hat! Do you think I&rsquo;m a lone-hander, without
      friends? Haven&rsquo;t you ever heard of Steer Bingham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My heart jumped. That was the of the names Jeff Dawlin had written down
      for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose you&rsquo;re holding out Ike Dawlin for a&mdash;&rdquo; I started,
      giving him a sharp look.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smacked his hand on his knee. &ldquo;Yes, Ike Dawlin. That&rsquo;s the kind of
      friends I&rsquo;ve got who will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine bunch to be afraid of if they all are as handy by as Ike Dawlin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ike Dawlin is East on a gold-brick game, and you know it,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;East&mdash;East&mdash;you plug-hat stiff! I&rsquo;ll show you whether he&rsquo;s East
      or not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is East along with &lsquo;Peacock&rsquo; Pratt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My cocksureness made him furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the jumped-up jeesicks, don&rsquo;t you suppose I know when Ike Dawlin lands
      back in the Potlatch country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to see him to believe it. Yes, or &lsquo;Peacock&rsquo; Pratt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You follow along on my heels and you&rsquo;ll see both of &rsquo;em all right!
      Next you&rsquo;ll claim to be a friend of theirs, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! If I really thought Ike Dawlin was in the Potlatch instead of back
      East I wouldn&rsquo;t be headed this way. <i>There&rsquo;s</i> one special man I
      wouldn&rsquo;t want to meet up with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dragg bounced up and down on the seat in his rage. I had prodded him
      as hard as I could in order to make sure that he knew what he was talking
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll get your dose of Ike Dawlin. I won&rsquo;t
      eat nor sleep till I find him. And he&rsquo;ll burn up the road getting to you.
      Ike Dawlin, eh? You don&rsquo;t dare to come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your eye on me. But if you can dig up Ike Dawlin in these parts come
      around and I&rsquo;ll hand you a present&mdash;maybe I&rsquo;ll hand back your guns!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dragg by that time was not a pleasant companion and I got up and went
      back through the train. He started after me, and then thought better of
      it. Probably he reflected that he had me either way. If I got frightened
      and went back he would be well rid of me as a rival in his scheme; if I
      came on he had Dawlin and the rest&mdash;and I surely believed his word
      about Dawlin&rsquo;s whereabouts. I did not know whether I was mighty glad that
      my chase was being guided in such handsome manner or was so dreadfully
      scared by the prospects just ahead of me that I was half minded to jump
      off the train; my feelings were very much mixed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when I met the gloomy stare of Zebulon Kingsley I grinned&mdash;I
      couldn&rsquo;t help it. There was a lot of grim humor in the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been raking in more dirty money, I suppose,&rdquo; he snarled, mistaking the
      nature of my smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have turned a better trick, sir. I have just met up with the most
      obliging chap I have found in a long time. He knows the man who fooled you
      into buying that gold brick. He is going to find him for us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; sneered the judge. &ldquo;This is only a wild, crazy, helter-skelter
      chase for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you the truth, sir! I never saw a man so enthusiastic about a
      kindness for strangers! He just told me that he wouldn&rsquo;t eat or sleep till
      he had found that fellow. Why, he is so headlong about the thing that I&rsquo;m
      afraid he&rsquo;ll find the chap before we&rsquo;re ready to meet him in proper
      style!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hump!&rdquo; sneered the judge, not taking a mite of stock in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked away and sat down by myself. There was sad truth in what I just
      told Kingsley. I was not ready to meet Ike Dawlin and &ldquo;Peacock&rdquo; Pratt.

    <h2>
      XVIII&mdash;THE ECCENTRICITIES OF ROYAL CITY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>&rsquo;LL confess that
      it took me a little while to screw up my resolution to the point where I
      could tell myself that I was entirely ready and willing to meet Ike Dawlin
      in the circle of his associates.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had left behind us brown fields where wheat grew, and had passed
      through the Idaho prune-orchards&mdash;a brakeman told me they were
      prune-orchards. We had come into the hill country and the railroad
      wriggled its way along the foot of the canon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took it for granted that Mr. Dragg proposed to stay with me. Every
      little while he came and set his nose against the glass of the car&rsquo;s
      forward door and glared at me. When we stopped at a station I stuck my
      head out of the window and made sure that he did not leave the train. The
      two of us were playing a sort of &ldquo;even Stephen&rdquo; game&mdash;silent
      peek-a-boo. I kept carefully away from Judge Kingsley, for I did not care
      to have Dragg report that I was in the company of an elderly man with a
      roll of chin-whiskers; Mr. Dawlin might recognize the description and take
      alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge sat close to the window, wrapped in his cloak, and scowled up at
      the canon&rsquo;s walls closing in behind as the railroad wound along. He looked
      as if he felt like a man headed for the innermost chambers of tophet, with
      the doors slamming behind him. As the hills shut in to the north, my
      feelings were of that sort, anyway!
    </p>
    <p>
      And so night came!
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been asking a lot of questions of that obliging brakeman. My folder
      named a terminus of the road and I had paid to that point, but I learned
      that the railroad had been stretched along six or eight miles farther down
      the canon so as to serve a mushroom town which was the depot for a freshly
      discovered mining section.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the train stopped at the old terminus, both Mr. Dragg and I found
      ourselves very curious in regard to each other; had it not been for the
      glass in the car door we would have bumped noses when we hurried to make
      mutual inspection. But he stayed on the train&mdash;and so did I.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a young, a very young railroad, that last bit. The train crawled
      like a caterpillar&mdash;and that&rsquo;s a good description, for the cars went
      bumping up slowly over the bulges in the track. Every now and then we got
      a side-slat which made me think we were going into the creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was too busy worrying about that train to give much thought to what was
      going to happen to me when I landed in &ldquo;Royal City&rdquo; along with Mr. Dragg.
      Such, I was informed, was the name of the new town. They certainly do pick
      good names to build up to in the West, just as Seth Dorsey, of Carmel,
      built a house on to the brass doorknob he found in the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Kingsley was not affording me much encouragement; he sat and hung on
      to the arm of his seat and glared unutterable reproach at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was considerably glad to get off that train.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as to Royal City! The place tickled me about as much as if it were a
      cemetery and I were riding in the hearse. It wasn&rsquo;t even as ripe as that
      railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first performance was to step into a mud-hole about half-way to my
      knees, and I wondered how my pearl-gray trousers stood up under that
      introduction to the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      I couldn&rsquo;t see Mr. Dragg or anybody else; there in that bowl among the
      hills the darkness was something a man could eat! We stumbled over
      upheavals of muddy earth, stepped into more holes, and made our way across
      the especially treacherous places along single planks which were half
      submerged in mire. A few lanterns, tied to short posts, were dim beacons
      to direct new arrivals from the railroad to the heart of the &ldquo;city.&rdquo; Quite
      a glare of lights marked the center of business activity. The slope of the
      hillside was dotted with bits of radiance from uncurtained windows. In
      that darkness only those points of light hinted at the extent of this new
      town. The dots were widely scattered, showing that Royal City was
      ambitiously endeavoring to cover as much ground as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      After threading the course marked by the lanterns we came to a stretch of
      pulpy mud which was bordered by a sidewalk of four planks abreast,
      evidently the main street of the place. There were buildings of
      considerable size on both sides of the thoroughfare, but these buildings
      certainly did put Royal City into the mushroom class. There was not a bit
      of stone or brick nor a clapboard or shingle in evidence. The buildings
      were constructed of beams, boards, laths, and tarred paper. They gave me
      the feeling that I could pop them between my hands like I&rsquo;d pop a blown-up
      paper bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lantern, hung on the corner of a building containing a store, lighted up
      a sign, &ldquo;Empire Avenue.&rdquo; The sign over the door of the store advertised
      the place as the &ldquo;Imperial Emporium.&rdquo; A fairly huge structure with
      tarred-paper outer walls was indicated by its sign as being the &ldquo;Imperial
      Hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing bashful about the names picked in Royal City!
    </p>
    <p>
      The windows of the &ldquo;Imperial Hotel&rdquo; shed plenty of light upon the sidewalk
      in front of it, and I caught sight of Dragg hurrying past as if he wished
      to be swallowed up in the shadow&rsquo;s on the other side. The man had reached
      the street ahead of us, for he had been in the smoking-car at the front of
      the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a chance and led Kingsley into the &ldquo;Imperial Hotel&rdquo; and registered
      in a book that a man in shirtsleeves tossed at me. I wrote &ldquo;Adam Mann&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;A. Fellow&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;A&rdquo; standing for &ldquo;Another,&rdquo; of course, and that
      wasn&rsquo;t bad for a quick grab at names. I did not care to advertise the name
      of Zebulon Kingsley to certain gentlemen in those parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the corner of my eye I saw Dragg peering in at the window when the
      man in shirt-sleeves led us upstairs to a room which held two narrow cots
      and an unpainted washstand with bowl and pitcher. The walls were of tarred
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this all you can give us for a room?&rdquo; asked the judge, as sour as
      vinegar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you expect in a new town&mdash;marble floors and gold door-knobs?
      I have taken care of better men than you and they haven&rsquo;t kicked.&rdquo; He
      turned on me; I had not said anything. &ldquo;You seem to have a rush of
      plug-hat to the brain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His impudence gave me my chance. Dragg had located me at that hotel and I
      wondered if I couldn&rsquo;t turn a little trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll move on and look for a landlord with better manners,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; advised the man. &ldquo;A lot of tenderfeet do the same thing and
      after they&rsquo;ve taken a look at the other place they come back here and beg
      for a room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the street I kept in the shadows. After a time we came to another hulk
      of paper and boards. Its sign read, &ldquo;Pallace Hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That extravagance in L&rsquo;s might hint at generosity, I pondered, but I had
      my doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Palace&rdquo; had a bar-room in the front of the house and there were many
      customers crowded at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go back to the other hotel, bad as it is,&rdquo; suggested the
      judge. &ldquo;There are drunken men in there and it is a wicked place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I put up my hand and pushed Kingsley back from the window into the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When one has business with wicked men those men must be followed to a
      wicked place, sir. I found fault with the other hotel on purpose. I didn&rsquo;t
      intend to stay there after I knew that a certain man thought he had
      located me for the night. It&rsquo;s a wise plan to keep wicked men guessing.
      Stay back here a moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stepped along and stared in at the window, hiding my face with my
      forearm.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw Dragg at the bar, and Dragg had a man by the arm and was whispering
      in his ear. Dragg&rsquo;s face expressed huge pleasure. He slapped the man on
      the back and bought drinks. After they had tossed off the liquor, Dragg
      resumed his business at the man&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man stood out in that slouchy group at the bar as a peacock would
      stand out among pullets in a hen-yard. He was distinctly a loud noise in
      the matter of wardrobe. He would have made a lurid smear even among the
      high dressers who top the crests of the Broadway crowds between
      Forty-second Street and Greeley&rsquo;s statue. He was of that sort of men who
      are paunchy and seem to be glad of it, because the extra beam affords them
      opportunity to display variegated waistcoats to better advantage. I
      realized that I was looking on &ldquo;Peacock&rdquo; Pratt.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments I tiptoed back to Kingsley, and, without speaking,
      propelled him to a spot where he could get a view of the men at the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you recognize anybody there, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is&mdash;the man who brought the brick&mdash;one of the infernal
      robbers!&rdquo; stuttered Kingsley. He was fairly beside himself with sudden
      excitement. His eyes had fallen first on the most conspicuous figure in
      the room. &ldquo;He has my money. I want it. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I pushed him back when he started to rush into the hotel. &ldquo;I guess
      that man wouldn&rsquo;t hand you his roll if you ran in there and snapped your
      fingers under his nose, Judge Kingsley. You recognize him, eh? That&rsquo;s
      enough for now. I&rsquo;ll tell you that your friend, there, is known in this
      section as &lsquo;Peacock&rsquo; Pratt, and he&rsquo;s a good man for us to stay away from
      for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know so much about these men&mdash;how do you know where to
      come to find them&mdash;dragging me across the continent?&rdquo; demanded the
      old man. His fury at sight of that smug blackleg had to blow off and I was
      the nearest object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to confess that I didn&rsquo;t know for sure I was to see this man
      here to-night. I had my line out and a good bait on, but I didn&rsquo;t believe
      I&rsquo;d get a bite so soon. You must keep cool, Judge Kingsley&mdash;keep cool
      and out of sight. Simply seeing that man isn&rsquo;t getting your money. We&rsquo;ve
      got considerable of a job ahead of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge was all of a tremble while we stood there at the edge of the
      shadow and watched the room and the drinkers. At last, with a flourish of
      his hand, Pratt gave orders to the bartender to fill all glasses. We heard
      his hoarse voice above all others. He tossed a bill on the bar and he and
      Dragg left in company and climbed the stairs leading up from the hotel
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Kingsley,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I left the other place and came over here
      hoping I could sneak close enough to a certain chap to overhear what he
      proposes to do about a little matter that I suggested to him a few hours
      ago. I see that he has found somebody to talk to. We&rsquo;ve got a handy sort
      of house for eavesdropping, but I want you to remember that the other
      fellow can hear us, too. Come along with me and keep your head. A lot
      depends!&rdquo; The &ldquo;Pallace&rdquo; was evidently more of a free and easy tavern than
      the &ldquo;Imperial.&rdquo; There was no register on the planks which served for an
      office desk. The proprietor looked up at us and leisurely lighted his pipe
      before answering my questions regarding accommodations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four dollars apiece&mdash;two in a room. Pay now. Includes breakfast, and
      there&rsquo;s a cold, stand-up supper out in the dining-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We bought box lunches from the brakeman on the train; we don&rsquo;t want
      supper,&rdquo; I explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Price just the same. Supper is there, and I ain&rsquo;t to blame if you don&rsquo;t
      want to eat it,&rdquo; stated the proprietor. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t look for any place to
      write your names,&rdquo; he added, noting that my eyes seemed to be searching
      for something that should be on the desk. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t keep books. And half
      the men who come along here can&rsquo;t write, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laid the money in his grimy hand and he fished two cards from his vest
      pocket and scrawled &ldquo;Brakfust&rdquo; on each with a lead-pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give &rsquo;em up to the table-girl in the morning. Now, gents, all the
      rooms up-stairs are just alike and there ain&rsquo;t no locks on the doors. Go
      up and help yourselves to any room that ain&rsquo;t being used. I hope you don&rsquo;t
      snore, either of you. It&rsquo;s apt to start gun-play from them that&rsquo;s trying
      to get to sleep in other rooms, and the walls we&rsquo;ve got up-stairs don&rsquo;t
      stop bullets. Sleep hearty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge followed me, muttering his opinions in regard to the hotel
      methods in Royal City.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; I warned. &ldquo;Tread lightly and keep still. It&rsquo;s a stroke of luck
      that he lets us pick our own rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smoky, stinking kerosene-lamps lighted dimly the corridor up-stairs.
      Unplaned planks formed the floor, and here again were the walls of tarred
      paper that had enabled Royal City to grow overnight. Some of the doors
      that gave upon the corridor were open, and the rooms were dark and
      apparently untenanted. Light shone from chinks in the walls here and
      there, in other places, showing that guests were in their rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tiptoed cautiously along the planks with ear out at each point where
      light sifted from crannies. Then I grasped the judge by the arm and thrust
      him into a room. I lighted the tiny lamp and motioned the old man to take
      a seat in the single chair. I sat on the edge of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a drunken man is on a topic that sops up all his interest, he not
      only iterates, he reiterates. It is hard to pry a wabbly tongue loose from
      the favorite topic. Intoxication seems to make the subject fresher and
      more entrancing with each repetition. The fuddled mind gets into a
      run-around, as men lost in snow or fog keep on traveling and always return
      to the same place. I had no means of determining how many times Dragg had
      been over the subject with Mr. Pratt, but that latter gentleman kept
      snarling out protests that the narrator did not heed. It was a story about
      how a stranger in a plug-hat&mdash;a shark of a lawyer&mdash;had
      hypnotized him, Dragg, on the train and had sucked out of him all his
      plans, projects, and secrets in regard to the new city of Breed and now
      proposed to rob said Dragg of all profits and rake-offs, and if a man
      could do that and get away with it what would be the use in any honest man
      starting out in the world and turning a trick for himself, as Dragg had
      proposed to do? So on and on, he gabbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, look here, &lsquo;Dangerflag&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;and this seemed a good nickname for
      Dragg&rsquo;s red face&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t con me any more as the human charlotte russe&mdash;the
      top part of me is hard! There ain&rsquo;t any such thing as hypnotizing a man
      when he doesn&rsquo;t want to be hypnotized. You were drunk and you slit open
      your little bundle of playthings for him to look at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t hypnotized how did he get two guns off me&mdash;and I sitting
      there not able to move hand or foot or wink my eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be more inclined to think you begged him to take &rsquo;em as a
      guarantee of friendship, and offered to kiss him in the bargain,&rdquo; sneered
      Mr. Pratt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you drunk, Dragg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wasn&rsquo;t to the give-my-shirt drunk stage that time,&rdquo; insisted the
      other. &ldquo;I was hiring him for a lawyer&mdash;driving a sharp trade with him&mdash;and
      then he hypnotized me and cleaned me out. And he&rsquo;s over there in the other
      hotel&mdash;and I&rsquo;m going to get to him before he puts me out of business.
      I&rsquo;ll tell you again&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the love of Jehoshaphat <i>don&rsquo;t</i> tell me again!&rdquo; protested Pratt.
      &ldquo;I have got it by heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told me where Ike Dawlin is. He is the only man that
      shark is afraid of. He told me so. He reckons that Ike is in the East.
      That makes him bold to do me dirt. I made believe that I know where Ike
      is. I tried to scare him, but the bluff didn&rsquo;t go. He is sure that Ike
      ain&rsquo;t West. You&rsquo;re Ike&rsquo;s regular partner, and you know where he is. I need
      him. Send for him, and we&rsquo;ll hold that plug-hatted skyootus here till Ike
      can whirl in and back him off. Blast him! I could have dropped him if this
      was ten years ago, even if he was from the East, and wore a plug-hat&mdash;and
      I could have got away with it&mdash;but the law sharks have been and tied
      us all up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to think twice before you try gun-play on a man from the East
      who comes wearing a plug-hat,&rdquo; advised Pratt. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty good sign
      that he is from the upper shelves back home, and somebody will be slammed
      hard if he gets hurt. Keep your hands off a plug-hatter, &lsquo;Dangerflag.&rsquo; I
      don&rsquo;t believe Ike would dip in, even if he were here. He&rsquo;s too comfortable
      just now to play scarecrow for your private interests. He might, if I
      asked him to, of course. But I don&rsquo;t see any reason for asking him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a half share in the Breed job,&rdquo; promised Dragg. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told
      you I would if you can gaff that law shark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Breed job looks like digging into a national bank vault with your
      thumb-nail,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Pratt, listlessly. &ldquo;A lot of law and
      complications! This re-locating business runs against snags always. I
      don&rsquo;t mind telling you that Ike and I find the old game a lot easier when
      we want to clean up an easy make. I&rsquo;ll be blamed if we could sell mining
      stock the last time we went East. What do you know about that? And then we
      nudged each other and turned around and speared three easy propositions on
      the good old gold-brick game. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;d still fall&mdash;but
      they do it. It&rsquo;s simply a case of go hunt in the odd corners for the right
      man. They&rsquo;re there, waiting. We peeled five thousand off the back of an
      old town treasurer&mdash;as soft money as we ever pulled. A town
      treasurer, mind you! We didn&rsquo;t have to go farther into the bush than that!
      You can&rsquo;t expect us to be very enthusiastic about a claim-jumping
      proposition just now&mdash;with plenty in our Dockets. Gimme a match! When
      you go to fighting a boom city and a railroad crowd, you&rsquo;ve got your work
      cut out for you&mdash;and just now I&rsquo;m feeling a lot like loafing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pratt was very wordy&mdash;but he was almighty interesting. Who was
      hugging the most money&mdash;he or Dawlin?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was plain to me that the town treasurer of Levant was holding in with
      difficulty. He twisted on his chair and his face was gray with anger and
      his lips moved. I scowled a warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can loaf on <i>my</i> job all right if you&rsquo;ll grab in,&rdquo; snapped
      Dragg, temper in his voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking you to break your neck. You
      have got the thing sized up all wrong. I don&rsquo;t expect to own Breed. I&rsquo;m
      going to operate on bluff. The Breed boomers and the railroad will come
      across rather than have the city set back by a hold-up of everything while
      land titles are being settled. If they&rsquo;ll hand me cash, I&rsquo;ll keep still,
      surrender my claim, and the new lines can be ran and locations filed
      before anybody wakes up. They&rsquo;ll see the point all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I reckon that the lawyer you hired on the train sees it all right,
      too,&rdquo; commented Pratt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what made me blow myself to him after I had dodged lawyers
      so long,&rdquo; mourned Dragg. &ldquo;But the way he was dressed made him look so
      mighty solid and reliable and honest&mdash;and his eyes were nice and
      brown! He got me! I tell you I was hypnotized. It wasn&rsquo;t just because I
      had budge in me. But he&rsquo;ll never get to Breed ahead of <i>me</i>. That&rsquo;ll
      be his game, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better make your getaway to-night and beat him to it,&rdquo; suggested Pratt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragg was profane in his rejection of this counsel. He stated that Pratt
      ought to have more sense than to think a project of that order could be
      settled by a sprinting-match.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what Callas prairie is in March as well as I do,&rdquo; he sputtered.
      &ldquo;It would be a gamble which one of us would get across first if it comes
      to a race through that &lsquo;&rsquo;dobe&rsquo; mud. It&rsquo;s all luck whether a
      stage-coach or a wagon or a cayuse gets through. I&rsquo;d have gone around and
      come into Breed from the south, but I thought I&rsquo;d rather tackle sixteen
      miles of Callas mud in March than ride six hundred miles in jerk-water
      trains. See here, Pratt, I&rsquo;ve got to have time to operate this thing
      without that shark hanging to me. He&rsquo;s afraid of Ike. I don&rsquo;t know what
      made him tell me so&mdash;but he was so mighty sure that Ike was East that
      he wanted to shoot his mouth off a little so as to aggravate me, I reckon.
      He has got to be held here in Royal City till I can pull off my job in
      Breed. I&rsquo;m not going to have him racing me around over the country, with a
      chance of his queering the whole proposition. Now come into this thing and
      help me out, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pratt yawned audibly and allowed that he would not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then get word to Ike Dawlin for me,&rdquo; pleaded Dragg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he wants to be bothered,&rdquo; drawled Pratt, indifferently. &ldquo;I
      won&rsquo;t send for him. That&rsquo;s final!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I think it would have been hard telling at that moment who was more
      disappointed, Mr. Dragg or myself!
    </p>
    <p>
      I had reckoned specially on Mr. Dawlin. He was boss of the gang, according
      to his brother&rsquo;s telling. In all Likelihood he was better thatched with
      greenbacks than anybody else in the band.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Furthermore,&rdquo; stated Mr. Pratt, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be bothered with your business.
      I have some of my own to attend to. I&rsquo;m going to jump the train to-morrow
      and get back to some place where it&rsquo;s safe to wear real clothes instead of
      a diving-suit or overalls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so I was going to lose Mr. Pratt!
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, I had not exactly made up my mind what to do with him if he
      remained in Royal City; but if he were to start on some kind of a hike and
      we were obliged to chase him we would betray ourselves and our case, sure
      as fate. Mr. Pratt was certainly no fool, and would know how to cover a
      trail the moment he suspected that somebody was chasing him. But I could
      see no reasonable way of keeping an independent gentleman of his nature in
      that dump of a Royal City.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, you are turning down a good lay when you duck out on this
      Breed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hell!&rdquo; snapped Pratt with all kinds of coarse scorn in his tone.
      &ldquo;About all this re-locating business amounts to is that you&rsquo;ll either be
      bored in the back or boarded in jail! I&rsquo;ve been studying the game, Dragg.&rdquo;
       He grew confidential. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I ran down here to this hog-wallow. Ike
      and I came. These lines here are run by guess and by gad! There&rsquo;s no clear
      title back of the land. We figured we would jump in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have the law behind you,&rdquo; insisted Dragg. &ldquo;Sure! And all the
      citizens who own guns, too! The trouble is, Dragg, they all know they&rsquo;re
      skating on thin ice. They are looking for something to drop. And so as to
      be ready for trouble when it comes they have gone to work and got just as
      mad as they can stick so that they can put a claim-jumper where he belongs
      in a hurry. None of it for me, Dragg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Dragg,&rdquo; insisted Mr. Pratt, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to be the man to put my
      name on to a re-location stake in this place! Law to back you&mdash;yes!
      But I have been testing out their temper! It&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But mobs don&rsquo;t do up men any longer in this part of the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I stated it a little strong, Dragg. But a fellow who tries to put
      anything over on this town, with the people here in their present temper,
      will get slammed into the pen&mdash;and there&rsquo;s no knowing when they&rsquo;ll
      let him out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And if that wasn&rsquo;t a straight tip from Mr. Pratt to a poor young chap in
      desperate need of good counsel and help in a ticklish matter, then I&rsquo;m no
      guesser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s back up the line for me&mdash;where I can buy a cocktail and get
      the smell of this tarred paper out of my clothes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Pratt&rsquo;s tip was such a helpful one that, providing Judge Kingsley
      had had a drop of sporting blood in him, I would have posted a little bet
      that Mr. Pratt would stay on with us for a while. I could see that the
      judge had made up his mind already that we had lost our Mr. Pratt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit here and don&rsquo;t make a sound!&rdquo; I whispered, and I pussy-footed for the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened his mouth and I shook my fist at him. I hoped I had on a
      demoniac expression&mdash;I tried to put one on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the devil, you and Dawlin, too!&rdquo; barked Dragg. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;ve got to
      handle this thing single-handed, the make will be all the bigger for me.
      I&rsquo;m all done worrying about an Eastern shyster beating me out of the game
      on my own stamping-ground. If he tries to take the stage in the morning to
      cross Callas prairie, I&rsquo;ll smash that plug-hat down over his eyes, yank
      them guns out from under his coat-tail and blow him into the middle of
      next week. I&rsquo;ll think up a story that will let me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, so Mr. Dragg must be considered along with &lsquo;Mr. Pratt and Mr. Dawlin!
    </p>
    <p>
      I left the room and hurried down-stairs, hoping the stores had not closed.
      My mind was mighty busy! I found a store that was still open. It was the
      &ldquo;Imperial Emporium&rdquo; and seemed to be well named, for I was able to
      purchase there a pair of shears, some spirit gum, a carpenter&rsquo;s
      lead-pencil, and a huge ball of twine. Then I hustled back to Zebulon
      Kingsley, who sat livid and rigid, listening to the bragging of the man
      who had robbed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose the stuff I tossed on the bed looked mighty queer to him, and I
      wasn&rsquo;t just sure about all of it myself. But I did not dare to ask any
      leading questions in Royal City about claim-jumping and I decided to
      tumble along alone, doing my little best as an amateur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zebulon Kingsley was in a sufficiently volcanic state of mind without any
      more stirring up.
    </p>
    <p>
      It&rsquo;s a wonder that I ever got away with what I started on next in my case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps his settled idea that I had lost my mind assisted in taming him
      enough so that he submitted in his fear that I might become violent. I
      look back now and wonder how I ever presumed so greatly even in the
      emergency that had arisen. But if &ldquo;Peacock&rdquo; Pratt were to remain in Royal
      City and if Ike Dawlin would join him, as I anticipated, the man with me
      must not be known as Zebulon Kingsley, of Levant, their victim. So I stood
      in front of Judge Kingsley and issued an ultimatum.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;ll never forget the look on his face!

    <h2>
      XIX&mdash;THE JOB Of AN ALTRUIST
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE judge sat there
      with his hat and coat on; the looks of that room did not invite anybody to
      take any comfort in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I leaned close to his ear and told him to stand up. Then I began to peel
      off his wrappings&mdash;overcoat, undercoat, and waistcoat. But when I
      unbuttoned his collar he pushed me away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain it out to you just as soon as I get a chance, sir,&rdquo; I
      whispered. &ldquo;But we mustn&rsquo;t make any noise here.&rdquo; I gathered my courage.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to cut off your beard!&rdquo; I had to clap my hand over his mouth to
      keep him quiet. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t argue now! If Pratt lays eyes on you he&rsquo;ll
      stampede. We mustn&rsquo;t let any of that money get away.&rdquo; I pushed him back
      upon the chair. &ldquo;Keep down your hands,&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be done.
      Your money is at stake&mdash;remember that! What&rsquo;s a few whiskers compared
      with ten thousand dollars!&rdquo; I was talking just as if I expected to swap
      hair for money.
    </p>
    <p>
      I confess I did not have much of a plan worked out just at that moment&mdash;but
      certain notions were coming to me in sections, as one might say. And the
      principal notion just then was that I must not let a set of whiskers, even
      if they grew on Judge Kingsley, flag the whole proposition. That was the
      first thing to look after, now that we were close to the game&mdash;change
      his looks!
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized as well as I that we couldn&rsquo;t start any riot there on our side
      of that paper partition. I don&rsquo;t believe any other consideration would
      have made him give in to me. If I had been getting his neck ready for the
      ax his looks would not have been more wild. I clipped his beard as
      carefully as I could with the shears and laid the tufts, as I removed
      them, in a little heap on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pratt was thoroughly tired of hearing Mr. Dragg repeat himself; we
      knew that because Mr. Pratt said so with a lot of vigor and stated that he
      was going to bed in his own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dragg advised him to be up early and see what happened to the
      &ldquo;plug-hatter,&rdquo; providing said &ldquo;plug-hatter&rdquo; tried to get away for Breed on
      the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; promised Mr. Pratt. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been having much fun down in
      this hog-wallow, and I need to have my feelings cheered up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he marched away down the corridor, making the whole building creak
      and shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dragg had considerable to say to himself, in the way of rehearsing his
      threats, while he was kicking off his shoes and getting ready for bed.
      Then his mutterings ended in a rasping snore&mdash;and he was off!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was glad he was asleep because that gave me a chance to talk to the
      judge, keeping my voice down cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some other plans, sir! I have had to think pretty quick! But the
      talk between those scamps has given me a rather good idea, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be wasting your time on a lot of silly business,&rdquo; muttered
      the judge. &ldquo;This is boy&rsquo;s play out of a detective dime novel, sir. We know
      where one of the robbers is. We can have him arrested. We can put the
      screws to him and find out where the other renegade is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that means going to law, Judge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must let the law handle it from now on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to do that, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the law will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The law will grab the crooks, maybe. But your money will be tied up along
      with &rsquo;em. We are strangers out here, Judge Kingsley. And you don&rsquo;t
      want the notoriety of the thing. Remember, you bought a gold brick!&rdquo; He
      winced, but it wasn&rsquo;t on account of the shears! &ldquo;Just getting those crooks
      into jail won&rsquo;t help your case,&rdquo; I insisted. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t much time to turn
      around in. The fifteenth of April isn&rsquo;t very far away. I reckon it&rsquo;s going
      to mean getting ten thousand dollars in ten days!&rdquo; He cringed. &ldquo;The law is
      too slow and careful for us just now! They pulled that money off by a
      trick. We must get it back by&mdash;&mdash; Well, I don&rsquo;t know just yet
      how we&rsquo;ll get it back&mdash;but it won&rsquo;t be by any law business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you intend to rob them and mix me into more trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rob &rsquo;em in a minute if I could do it and get away,&rdquo; I told
      him, calmly. And then, because he was getting excited, I advised him to
      keep his jaw still so that the shears might not slip and cut him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the clipping was done I got my little kit out of my bag and got ready
      to shave him; there was a tin dish full of water in the corner of the
      room. Of course he was glad to have the stubble I had left under his chin
      scraped off, and submitted quietly. However, I knew my real tussle with
      Judge Zebulon Kingsley was just ahead of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the wall there was a little mirror with glass so wavy that it made a
      human face seem like the physog of a baboon. I pulled it down and showed
      the judge his countenance with his whiskers off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see it doesn&rsquo;t change your looks very much, after all, Judge. Your
      beard was all under your chin instead of on your face.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t want to
      jump him too suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have changed my looks as much as that glass represents, you&rsquo;ve
      done a good job,&rdquo; he said, dryly. It was the first time I had ever heard
      anything like humor from him, and I was cheered and made bolder&mdash;so
      bold that I came right out with it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to change your appearance just a bit more, Judge. I know how to
      do it, for I did it once in my own case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I uncorked the bottle of gum. But when I started toward him he did not
      depend on his hands for defense&mdash;he put up his foot and pushed me
      away. I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use going half-way in this thing, sir. It only means a
      mustache for you out of your own beard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be cockawhooped up in any such style!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to let those men recognize you as the town treasurer of
      Levant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glared at me and kept his foot up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re after the money&mdash;we&rsquo;re after the money!&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;Just think
      what a little thing this is you&rsquo;re balking on, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you give me no hint as to how you expect to get the money! I&rsquo;m at the
      end of my patience. I won&rsquo;t submit to any more foolishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t foolishness, Judge Kingsley! It&rsquo;s a precaution we must take.
      I&rsquo;ve got a plan to keep those men from jumping out on us in the morning&mdash;and
      they&rsquo;ll be sure to see you.&rdquo; I pushed down his foot and I picked up the
      hair on the bed and looked resolute. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be done, sir. I&rsquo;m going
      to do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave in to me as he had in other cases when I became savage, but I
      realized that fury boiled in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made a mighty good job of it, if I do say so, but he angrily refused to
      look at himself in the glass. I used all the hair in his beard and gave
      him a mustache that fairly cut in half that hatchet face of his; his best
      friend would not have known Judge Kingsley.
    </p>
    <p>
      I advised him to go to bed and to be sure to sleep on his back so that the
      mustache would not be disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sharpened the carpenter&rsquo;s pencil and hid the ball of twine under my
      coat, the judge looking at me as savage as a bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know anything about the right way of relocating a claim?&rdquo; I asked.
      &ldquo;Anything in law about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more likely to be described in the thieves&rsquo; catechism,&rdquo; he snarled.
      &ldquo;I have never owned a copy!&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      That&rsquo;s all the help I got from <i>him!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, if I didn&rsquo;t know much about the regular way, I reckoned I could make
      considerable trouble in town by blundering along with a little way of my
      own. So I tiptoed down-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently Royal City had quit the job and gone to sleep. The hotel office
      was dark, and when I stepped forth into the night there was no glimmer of
      light anywhere. Even the lanterns that served as the city&rsquo;s municipal
      lighting-plant in the streets had burned out or had been blown out. It was
      a case of grope, but I had looked about carefully when I went shopping and
      had a pretty good memory for locations.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little pile of laths at the corner of the hotel. I had noticed
      them when I had lurked in the shadows with Judge Kingsley. I picked up a
      lath and wrote on its side, well up toward one end, &ldquo;Relocated. Dragg.&rdquo;
       Then I pushed the lath down into the mud at the corner of the hotel and
      tied to it the end of the ball of twine. With several laths under my arm I
      proceeded a few paces, unwinding the twine, and pushed another lath down
      and knotted my string about its end. Thus I circumnavigated the hotel,
      sticking down marked laths, knotting about them the twine. In this fashion
      I calculated I had declared on one Dragg a re-location of the hotel site&mdash;or
      rather made it seem that Dragg had tried on a clumsy trick to jump a land
      claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      With footsteps muffled by the mud of Royal City, moving unseen in the
      night, I was truly a generous cuss. I located nothing for myself. I took
      the &ldquo;Imperial Emporium&rdquo; for Pratt, and re-located the site of the
      &ldquo;Imperial Hotel&rdquo; for Dawlin. Then I stole back into the tavern, taking off
      my muddy shoes at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      That slatted bed and the snores pealing everywhere kept me awake nearly
      all night, and next morning I was down before anybody else was stirring.
      In the gray dawn out slouched from an inner room the landlord, yawning,
      growling, blinking&mdash;beginning his day&rsquo;s duties in a distinctly
      grouchy frame of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time does the stage-coach leave for Breed City?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody but a fool would take a stage for Breed this time of year&mdash;but
      a man who comes out here in March and mud-time, wearing a plug-hat, must
      be a fool. So you&rsquo;ll leave at ha&rsquo;f pas&rsquo; six,&rdquo; was the landlord&rsquo;s genial
      response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what time is breakfast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time for you to get the stage. What do you want to ask such a cussed fool
      question as that for? What do you think I&rsquo;m getting up to do at this hour
      in the morning?&rdquo; Well, I wasn&rsquo;t in any jolly mood myself. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
      but you might be up to sing a hymn to the morning star.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;re looking for trouble, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; bawled the landlord. He came
      from behind the counter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cave that plug&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That made me good and mad! &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m looking for cartridges to fit my
      guns,&rdquo; I stated, pulling both weapons. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got only twelve left&mdash;six
      in each chamber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My friend checked himself so suddenly that he nearly tumbled on his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the store open early?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the landlord, quite respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll take a stroll up that way. Make my bacon thick and be very
      careful not to fry the juice out of it.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s nothing like establishing
      a bit of a reputation in a strange town, especially if a fellow has
      planted seeds of trouble; I could see those laths through the window! I
      had begun to feel rather devilish. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the landlord. &ldquo;We aim to please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I glanced at my work of the evening before as I sauntered along the plank
      walk. The new laths and the white twine showed up well against the black
      adobe mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sounds of housekeeping, clatter of dishes and of stove-covers indicated
      that the proprietor of the &ldquo;Emporium&rdquo; dwelt over the store. I rattled the
      door, and at last the man appeared and unlocked it from within. He was
      surly and slatted the box of cartridges across the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it because you don&rsquo;t care for early customers that you have built a
      fence of laths and string about your place?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no such thing there.&rdquo; But he hurried to the door. He gazed.
      He ran to the nearest lath and stooped down and read what was written
      thereon and cracked his fists together and kicked the lath and stamped it
      into the mud and swore loudly. &ldquo;Pratt, hey? &lsquo;Peacock&rsquo; Pratt trying one of
      his gambling bluffs because titles ain&rsquo;t been settled here yet, is he? If
      a kettle-bellied catfish like Pratt thinks he can jump a city lot on me
      he&rsquo;s got trouble coming his way on the down grade with the axle greased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was much more that the infuriated merchant had to say regarding the
      general standing of Pratt, but I did not linger. I strolled into the
      &ldquo;Imperial Hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d come back&mdash;they all do; but you can&rsquo;t do business with
      me,&rdquo; the landlord informed me before I had opened my mouth. &ldquo;Once you turn
      your nose up at my house, then up it stays, as far as I am concerned!
      Mosey back to your pig-pen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! But I&rsquo;ll drop back here when the new proprietor takes hold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What new proprietor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s a man named Dawlin. I note that his name appears as the
      man who has re-located this property.&rdquo; The landlord took a jump and a look
      and saw the laths and string. He ran out of doors. He was an able-bodied
      man with a large voice, and he outdid his merchant neighbor in volume of
      cursing. It was plain that he was well acquainted with the mental and
      moral qualities of Ike Dawlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I went back to my own tavern. Judge Kingsley was waiting in the office,
      and the landlord was talking to the old man with considerable affability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was telling your friend here that we aim to please! I reckon the girl
      can fit you out with breakfast now if you&rsquo;re minded to step into the
      dining-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;we&rsquo;ll step in, sir. By the way, there seems to be
      considerable excitement on the street, Mr. Landlord. Men named Dawlin and
      Pratt, whoever they may be, have re-located business sites occupied by the
      big store and the other hotel. I just noticed that the same thing has been
      done to you; you&rsquo;d better take a look outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the manner in which the owner of the &ldquo;Pallace&rdquo; pounded his way to the
      street it might have been guessed that the consciences of the pioneers of
      Royal City were not wholly clear as to their several rights of property.
      But the manner in which they were taking the re-locations showed that they
      were entirely ready to fight for what they had squatted on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bald-headed juductionary of Walla Walla County,&rdquo; howled the
      &ldquo;Pallace&rdquo; landlord, &ldquo;that tinhorn Dragg has sneaked out of my house in the
      night so as to do me up, has he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you say it&rsquo;s Dragg?&rdquo; bawled the landlord of the &ldquo;Imperial&rdquo; from a
      distance. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dawlin, up here! He&rsquo;s been boozing here in my house under
      cover for a week, but he wasn&rsquo;t so drunk, so it seems, but he could dodge
      out last night and try to steal my property away from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Say, I swapped one very large look with Zebulon Kingsley, who stood in the
      hotel door, staring from furious landlord to furious landlord. The old man
      had heard enough the night before to appreciate the value of that
      information in regard to Dawlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that skunk of a dressed-up Pratt in my case,&rdquo; shouted the owner of
      the &ldquo;Emporium&rdquo; from farther up the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I can show any man who tries to steal my property that I&rsquo;m
      mighty wide awake mornings if I do sleep nights when honest men ought to
      be in bed,&rdquo; announced the proprietor of the &ldquo;Pallace.&rdquo; He rushed into his
      hotel, and clattered up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the wheels of a scheme are running in good shape it&rsquo;s best to stay
      away and keep your fingers out of the gearing,&rdquo; I said to Kingsley. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
      go in and eat breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While we ate, loud voices sounded through the thin walls. Men were
      crowding into the hotel office. Profanity, denunciation, denial, went on
      and on. The judge fingered his makeshift mustache uneasily every time the
      bawling of Pratt was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better keep your hands off that and drink your coffee from your spoon,&rdquo; I
      suggested. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never know you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we were ready to leave the dining-room I warned the judge not to look
      at Pratt. We could hear him thundering away in the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragg and Pratt were surrounded by men; the landlord of the &ldquo;Pallace,&rdquo; the
      proprietor of the &ldquo;Emporium,&rdquo; and a grim man with a huge revolver in his
      hand and a deputy sheriff&rsquo;s badge on his breast were right in the front
      row.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can swear, threaten, and deny till your tongues drop off&mdash;it
      don&rsquo;t go for a minute with us,&rdquo; declared the landlord, &ldquo;for we all know
      your style and your nerve. Because you have got away with a lot of
      hold-ups in other places it doesn&rsquo;t go that you can come here and do us in
      Royal City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;d be fools enough to go and put our names on&mdash;&rdquo;
       began Dragg, but he was promptly interrupted by the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose names would you put on if you were trying to steal land for
      yourselves? You thought we&rsquo;d rather settle than fight, that&rsquo;s what! But
      we&rsquo;re going to fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was my turn&mdash;and my chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, gentlemen. I&rsquo;m a stranger to you all&mdash;merely a passing
      tourist. But I feel it&rsquo;s my duty to state that I heard two men discussing
      a matter of re-locating land last evening. They were in the next room to
      mine in this hotel. I recognize their voices. Those are the men.&rdquo; I
      pointed to Dragg and Pratt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deputy poked the muzzle of his gun into Dragg&rsquo;s face to make him stop
      swearing. &ldquo;Shut up! Everybody can see that this is a real gent, and if
      he&rsquo;s got evidence we want to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The evidence isn&rsquo;t much,&rdquo; I said, meekly, &ldquo;but I distinctly heard them
      say that they could clean up a nice pile of money by a re-location scheme.
      It was to be bluff to a large extent. If that information is worth
      anything you&rsquo;re welcome to it. I would hate to see the prosperity of a
      hustling city like this held up for one moment by men trying to bunco
      honest citizens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You listen to me,&rdquo; roared Dragg. &ldquo;That hellhound there is lying like a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff slapped him across the mouth. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no real gent gets
      insulted by you in Royal City while I&rsquo;m boss of law and order here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outdoors was a noise of clanking of whiffletrees and the &ldquo;ruckling&rdquo; of
      wheels. A stage-coach, mud-daubed from tongue to roof-rail, was pulling
      out of an opposite stable-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to take that stage,&rdquo; raved Dragg. &ldquo;The whole of Royal City can&rsquo;t
      stop me. I&rsquo;ve been monkey-doodled by a shark. He&rsquo;s trying to get there
      ahead of me. It wouldn&rsquo;t work here. I&rsquo;m no fool. I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;
       He yelled so loudly and talked so rapidly that they listened to him. &ldquo;My
      scheme was for Breed&mdash;and it was a cinch! He&rsquo;s stealing it from me&mdash;that
      doggone, lying plug-hatter found out that I was going to re-locate claims
      in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seem to be convicting yourself out of your own mouth!&rdquo; broke in a
      citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Breed by this stage. I&rsquo;ve got to go!&rdquo; gasped Dragg, twisting
      his throat from the sheriff&rsquo;s clutch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going into the calaboose right now&mdash;and Pratt is going there,
      too, and Dawlin is going as soon as they get his clothes on him,&rdquo; declared
      the officer. &ldquo;Grab a-holt, boys, and help me get on the wristers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You men will stay here&mdash;and Dawlin, too, till we find out what you
      mean by this trick,&rdquo; said my landlord. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get out of here to run
      away and file your location claims!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send a man to the county-seat,&rdquo; raged Pratt. &ldquo;Look at the records. That
      will prove that we haven&rsquo;t tried anything on here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need any advice from you chaps as to what we shall do&mdash;whether
      it&rsquo;s holding you for a show-down or shooting you out of this place when we
      have your numbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Mr. Pratt. That remark started my think-works into action. I
      had my men anchored, to be sure, but that wasn&rsquo;t getting me anything in
      the money line&mdash;and without doubt Royal City would cool down pretty
      quickly and send the men kiting. When they scooted they would go by rail,
      of course. That meant difficulties, the thought of which had already
      discouraged me. I needed to keep those chaps in the open&mdash;and the
      wilder the open the better! In the brush, where it was man to man, instead
      of in the city where law was safe and sane&mdash;and almighty slow! I
      needed to be quick and crazy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pratt was beginning to get his wits back. He was bellowing so wildly
      when I accused him and Dragg that he did not seem to sense the situation.
      He turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn your lying tongue! What do you mean by putting up this job on me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have simply stated what I overheard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard me say that I was going to jump claims? Why, I told Dragg I
      wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told Dragg that you and your partner came down here on purpose to
      jump claims!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was so mad he was nigh black in the face. &ldquo;Do I know you? Have I ever
      done dirt to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head and looked him over with contempt. From the time I had
      left Levant I had been at a loss to decide what front I would put on when
      I met up with those men who had robbed the judge. I had thought all along
      that my best plan would be to build on my acquaintance with Jeff Dawlin
      and use his tips which were to put me next to the parties I was after.
      Then I might be able to come up on their blind side&mdash;if they had one&mdash;and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, right there I had stopped. What could I do? Then I had been hooked
      by that infernal Dragg! In that mess with him I had allowed chance to
      swing me and our fortunes. After that squabble with Dragg I could not hope
      to make much of a hit with his associates, eh? Therefore, I was jumping
      for the other extreme and I proposed to make Mr. Pratt and his friends
      just as ugly as insults and injury could serve. I felt like a boy thumbing
      his nose at angry wildcats. And in my desperation I hoped that the
      wildcats would come chasing me. Chasing me where? Why not to Breed,
      wherever that might be?
    </p>
    <p>
      I certainly was sure of Mr. Dragg, according to his threats and his
      promises. And if I could stick a few more darts into the broad flanks of
      Mr. Pratt and leave them stinging it was full likely that Mr. Dragg&rsquo;s
      appeals to that gentleman would have much more effect than they did the
      night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of citizens came dragging in another prisoner, a red-eyed and
      ferociously angry person, and I knew by Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s expression that
      the round-up was complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who says I did it? Who says I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say so!&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;You held me up and you asked me to buy twine and
      pencil for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; stated the merchant. &ldquo;The gent is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it looked all square to me,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I never heard how
      claim-jumpers worked!&rdquo; I told them. &ldquo;I saw he had been drinking and I
      thought the string-and-pencil notion was only his bee buzzing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was reckless lying, but that crowd was too much excited to bother with
      mere details.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you mutt-jawed smokestack, you, I never laid eyes on you in all my
      life!&rdquo; raged Dawlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon my memory is a little better than yours, for I wasn&rsquo;t drunk,&rdquo; I
      reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff was obliged to assign two more men to the controlling of Mr.
      Dawlin, who was a husky chap. He was far too much occupied to pay any
      attention to the judge, who stood in a corner and goggled at me with plain
      and sure conviction that I had gone stark, staring crazy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you a thousand dollars,&rdquo; roared Pratt, &ldquo;that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cheap tinhorn. You never saw a thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pratt jumped up and down and tried to throw off the clutch of the men
      who were holding him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt perfectly safe in that crowd; I made up my mind to keep prodding
      till I was sure that Mr. Pratt and his friends had developed enough
      interest in me so that they would give up all other business till they had
      settled their grudges.
    </p>
    <p>
      I patted my breast pocket. &ldquo;I always carry ten thousand dollars around
      with me just to keep the draughts off my chest. I find money better than a
      folded newspaper,&rdquo; I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been keeping my eye on the stage-coach for some few minutes. It had
      hauled up at the post-office. The driver came out with mail-bags and
      tossed them into the boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Landlord, will you fetch our valises?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a few thousand in my own pocket,&rdquo; yelled Pratt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have I!&rdquo; howled Dawlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll spend it getting to you,&rdquo; they shouted in chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t cost you much to chase <i>me</i>,&rdquo; I said, provokingly. &ldquo;Cheap
      skates of your sort wouldn&rsquo;t spend much getting to a man you&rsquo;re afraid
      of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That taunt, in the ears of those bystanders, made Pratt and his cronies
      wild in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only going as far as Breed,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to stay there for some
      time on business. When these good folks let you out of jail suppose you
      run over and call on me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t dare to wait there for us!&rdquo; said Dawlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you five thousand I do dare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They didn&rsquo;t take me up on that bet. Perhaps I seemed too certain that I
      meant what I said. I intended to seem certain. I wanted the company of
      those gentlemen in Breed, no matter what the risks were. And I was mighty
      glad when Mr. Pratt and Mr. Dawlin had bragged about the thousands they
      had in their pockets. I looked into the glittering eyes of Pratt and I
      knew that even in his fury he was taking much comfort in his belief that I
      was giving him a straight tip about Breed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t dare to hang up over there till I come,&rdquo; he snarled, testing me
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am not there, I&rsquo;ll hand over five hundred dollars to start a city
      reading-room here,&rdquo; I declared. &ldquo;I call on these gentlemen to bear
      witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope we won&rsquo;t get the reading-room,&rdquo; stated the landlord, standing with
      the luggage, &ldquo;for I want to see a few fresh galoots get theirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to test out whether respectable business men can go about in
      this country without being insulted and bothered by rascals,&rdquo; I observed.
      &ldquo;Come over to Breed after Royal City gets done with you.&rdquo; And just to
      clinch the thing I snapped my fingers under Pratt&rsquo;s nose when I passed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I just naturally knew, that moment, that Mr. Pratt had made a binding
      appointment with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord had hailed the stage, which was surging past through the mud.
      I was obliged to push the judge to start him toward the door; he seemed to
      be in a daze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got to stay here,&rdquo; he croaked in my ear. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got the money
      on &rsquo;em. They brag about it. You&rsquo;ll never lay eyes on them again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hurried him along the plank walk toward the coach. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret one mite
      about that part, sir. If we stay here all we can do is stand outside the
      calaboose and ask &rsquo;em to push our money out through the bars. And
      I&rsquo;m afraid they are not feeling generous enough just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the law will keep them&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it won&rsquo;t, sir, if I&rsquo;m any judge of the sporting blood out here. Royal
      City will be mighty curious to find out what happens when Mr. Pratt and
      his friends arrive in Breed. And they&rsquo;ll come! Don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the judge was a stubborn old customer! He kept holding back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not settle it with &rsquo;em here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have always read that when a good general has a chance to do
      it, he picks his own battle-ground and throws up his earthworks before the
      enemy heaves in sight. I have picked Breed, sir! As to the earthworks,
      I&rsquo;ll do some meditating on the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Already my handy Mr. Dragg had given me the germ of a notion, though, of
      course, he had not meant to make me any presents.

    <h2>
      XX&mdash;ACROSS CALLAS
    </h2>
    <p>
      THERE were four or five passengers inside the coach, and I boosted the
      judge over the wheel and put him in there. There was no one on the box
      with the driver, and that was not surprising, for I must say he did not
      have any coaxing way with him: he had his fists full of muddy reins and
      looked down on me with his mouth screwed around. I asked meekly if I might
      ride up there with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you think a plug-hat is going to help me any getting acrost sixteen
      miles of &rsquo;dobe clay, climb up! But do one thing or t&rsquo;other damn
      quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It did not look as if I would be making a specially promising friend, but
      I climbed just the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck!&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;and I hope you&rsquo;ll take it all right from
      us if we let &rsquo;em loose after we have shaken &rsquo;em down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send &rsquo;em along, sir. One at a time or the lot in a bunch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That little speech suited the crowd; I got a lot of friendly hand-waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few rods from the last house in Royal City the muddy street swung to the
      right and sort of sneaked into the river, as if it were ashamed and wanted
      to wash the dirt off itself. There was no bridge. The horses plunged into
      the water and dragged the coach across the stream, floundering in depths
      that barely allowed them footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side of the river the road whiplashed in long curves up the
      canon&rsquo;s wall to reach the level of Callas prairie; I should say it was all
      of a thousand feet above the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      I offered to the driver comments on the weather, on the road: I offered
      him a cigar. I had stocked up with smokes with which to curry favor. The
      driver paid no attention to the comments and snarled his refusal of the
      cigar. Even with six horses leaping to their work under the lash, our
      crawl up the muddy slope was snail-like. The wheelers and swing team got
      the whip, and the driver heaved curses and little rocks at the leaders. He
      had nearly a peck of pebbles in a canvas bag at his side. When we were
      over the rim-rock at last and upon the prairie, I looked for more speed.
      But no such luck! The straining horses, half-way to their knees in the
      black mud, could barely move the heavy coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time the driver left what some flatterers might call a road and
      took to the open prairie, zigzagging here and there to find solid ground.
      Then intersecting gullies drove him back into the rutted road again. It
      was adobe mud&mdash;black as zip and as sticky as cold molasses. Every
      little while the driver was obliged to jump down from his seat and poke
      the clotted mud out between the spokes of the wheels. Otherwise the coach
      would have been anchored in spite of the best tussles of the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think they&rsquo;d have to give up trying to run a stage across this
      prairie in mud-time,&rdquo; I ventured to suggest to the driver when he came
      climbing back to his seat after a long assault on the mud-clogged wheels
      with his piece of joist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mails <i>have</i> to go, but the damn fools that I haul don&rsquo;t have
      to,&rdquo; he retorted, sorting his reins between his muddy fingers. &ldquo;If you
      ain&rsquo;t satisfied with the way I&rsquo;m running this thing, mister, you can tuck
      yourself into that plug-hat of yours and roll across to Breed City.
      E-e-oyah! Go &lsquo;long, you wall-eyed, splint-legged goats of the Bitter Root,
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, I was thankful I was on the outside; the sun warmed me and the
      warmth was grateful, for the breeze was chilly on that upland. I could see
      snow on the far-distant peaks to the south. The passengers inside the
      coach were plainly far from feeling any thankfulness whatsoever. They
      groaned and growled and complained. I glanced down over the side dining
      one stop for wheel-clearing, and found myself looking into the face of
      Judge Kingsley, who had stuck his head out of the window. His false
      mustache gave him the appearance of an angry cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much more of this devilishness have we got to endure?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy figuring, sir! Sixteen miles, sixteen hours! It must be the
      regular running time on this road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want no sarcasm from no one,&rdquo; yelped the driver, straightening up
      and shaking his joist. &ldquo;And if any gent reckons he can keep passing out
      his cheap slurs on this trip he&rsquo;d better come down here now and get his
      card entitling him to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I kept my gaze on the distant mountains, but when the driver climbed back
      to his seat and kept on cussing me out, I reckoned we&rsquo;d better have a
      little understanding for the rest of the trip. I closed my fingers around
      his arm. It was only a pipe-stem arm&mdash;and his eyes were of the sad,
      pale-blue kind. I said very near to his ear: &ldquo;Your breakfast seems to be
      hurting you, son! The stage company pays you to drive and to be respectful
      to passengers. Mind your tongue after this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was trying on a little something. I have found that when you bluster and
      shout, the blusterer usually recognizes his own kind and blusters back.
      But the blowhard hasn&rsquo;t any weapon when a man fights with a look and a
      quiet word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the mud. It&rsquo;s getting on to my nerves,&rdquo; whined the man after he had
      driven a short distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a smoke&mdash;it&rsquo;s good for the nerves,&rdquo; I invited. The driver&rsquo;s
      hands were full of reins and whip and pebbles, so I set the end of a cigar
      to the drooping mouth and the driver bit off the end. Then I held a match
      while he sucked. And when the cigar was going he turned an appreciative
      grin on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fellow can&rsquo;t bluff you much, can he, mister?&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      have you sized up right at the start-off, I reckon. Why, <i>I</i> couldn&rsquo;t
      lick a prairie-dog with a hammer. But I bluff out most of the dudes who
      travel with me. I get a lot of innocent enjoyment that way. It helps pass
      the time for me on this jodiggered trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out of his cocoon of grouchiness he broke as a real butterfly of chatter.
      I got a lot of good stuff from him, for I learned the name of the mayor of
      Breed City and what sort of a man he was&mdash;a dry-goods merchant who
      took his job seriously and hollered about the development of the new place
      and loved those who said a good word for the municipality.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also learned that many miners and prospectors from the Buffalo Hump
      region were mudbound, on their annual spree, in Breed&mdash;the nearest
      town where they could find all the rum and roulette they demanded. The
      driver stated that one or two of his friends who had a little spare cash
      for speculation made it a practice to loaf around the gambling-places and
      buy in from busted players any mining shares that a man wanted to realize
      on in a hurry. Most of these shares thus offered for sale were shares in
      undeveloped prospects, the driver explained, but one could never tell when
      a share bought for a cent would be worth a hundred. That driver certainly
      liked the sound of his voice when he got started! He offered the
      confidential tip that the Blacksnake Gully region would develop into the
      howler of the season. It wasn&rsquo;t being talked of much. Nothing real
      definite was known outside. He guessed they hadn&rsquo;t opened up anything to
      prove the hunch some folks had&mdash;but mining is like betting on the
      races. A tip floats in from somewhere&mdash;if a hunch goes with it, play
      it, that was his motto. He had been able to pick up a few loose shares.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mine in which he was most interested had been located for a long time.
      Shares had been out for some years, scattered around. He couldn&rsquo;t tell for
      sure who had started the new stories, but he did know that a friend of his&mdash;an
      humble friend called &ldquo;Dirty-shirt&rdquo; Maddox&mdash;was up in this section,
      nosing around, and he reckoned he&rsquo;d get some inside information when
      &ldquo;Dirty-shirt&rdquo; returned to Breed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I wasn&rsquo;t surprised. My idea of the West was a place where every
      man was trying to unload mining stock on an Eastern sucker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The particular claim in the Blacksnake that I&rsquo;m speaking of is &lsquo;Her Two
      Bright Eyes,&rsquo;&rdquo; stated the gossiper. &ldquo;Mebbe that name is a hunch that it&rsquo;s
      worth looking into,&rdquo; he added, with a cackle to point his little joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought of a couple of bright eyes, and felt homesick when the driver
      drawled the name of the mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two bright eyes are always worth looking into,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was some ride!
    </p>
    <p>
      The stage wallowed into Breed City about nightfall. It had tipped over
      twice on the way, its wheels sinking into &ldquo;honey-pots&rdquo; of mud, rolling
      over slowly like a tired cow lying down to rest. We swearing passengers
      had been compelled to pry it up with poles borrowed from a rancher. During
      these waits and during the meal at a sort of half-way house, Judge
      Kingsley, mud-spattered, scared into conniptions when he thought of what
      would be coming behind us from Royal City, miserable as a wet cat, and
      seeing nothing ahead for consolation, muttered to me constantly his
      familiar taunt that he was being teamed about the country by a lunatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t know exactly what to say, and made him still angrier by
      confessing that he was undoubtedly correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      We left the coach in front of the hotel that the driver had recommended,
      and we stepped from the board sidewalk like passengers disembarking from a
      boat; the mud in the street was fairly a river of mire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if you don&rsquo;t like the &lsquo;Prairie Pride&rsquo; very well,&rdquo; my new friend had
      said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have a lot of fun watching the White Ghost operate. There&rsquo;s
      only one of his kind in these parts, or anywhere else in the world, so
      fur&rsquo;s I know. Folks come from a long ways off and stand around the windows
      and doors of the &lsquo;Prairie Pride&rsquo; hotel and see the White Ghost perform. Oh
      no, I don&rsquo;t mean that the house is haunted. The White Ghost is the waiter.
      He&rsquo;s the only waiter they have in the dining-room. He won&rsquo;t have anybody
      else there. He prides himself on doing it all alone. Says he is the only
      waiter in the world who can handle fifty guests and four Chinese cooks
      single-handed and keep everybody happy and busy eating. He&rsquo;s a little
      cracked in the head, but he&rsquo;s sure a wonder on his feet. A streak of white
      lightning would have to whistle for him to turn around and come back and
      meet it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now this bit of information, when I listened to it, stirred in me merely a
      half-determination to go to another hotel, where the waiter did not give a
      show along with his services.
    </p>
    <p>
      How often does man slight some odd tools that Fate lays in his way,
      especially when Fate doesn&rsquo;t draw his attention to them!
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Prairie Pride&rdquo; hotel deserved its name in some measure. It had smooth
      floors, real doors, and walls of plaster. Its big office thronged with
      guests, whose character was plain enough. There were slick drummers and
      bearded and booted miners fresh from the hills, down for a bit of a spring
      whirl, and there were mining engineers and such like.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were given a room and at the same time we were given a hint that we&rsquo;d
      better hurry to supper before the hungry mob cleaned up all the best
      dishes. Again my clothes coaxed this courtesy!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cross the big dining-room and go into the alcove,&rdquo; directed the clerk,
      after a glance at my hat. &ldquo;The alcove is for gents. We herd the others in
      the big room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I crossed this main hall a few steps in advance of Judge Kingsley. Men
      were crowded at the tables gobbling food. No fancy feeding! Men jabbed
      knives into their mouths and grabbed stuff off plates and smacked their
      lips and snuffled and grunted. I stopped in the alleyway between these
      tables to look about. I heard a yell of warning and dodged just in time to
      escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Double swinging doors with spring hinges were burst open by the impact of
      a foot that must have been swung waist high for the kick. Out into the
      dining-room shot the individual who had kicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an apparition!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was more than six feet tall and as slim as a beanpole. He wore a white
      cap, a white jacket, a white apron shrouded him to his heels, and he wore
      white shoes. He had a white, peaked face and his hair was tow-colored. On
      a huge tray that he held well above his head dishes were heaped high. He
      went past me and down the alleyway on the dead run, and wisps of steam
      from his load followed after, trailing on the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to keep out of the road in this dining-room when the White Ghost
      is on the rampage,&rdquo; advised a guest at the table in the alcove where we
      took seats. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to get somebody some day fine and plenty. A few
      months ago he got old Babb Coan, who was down here on crutches, nursing a
      broken leg, and couldn&rsquo;t get out of the way in season. But the White Ghost
      was loaded with empty dishes&mdash;just empties. Some day he&rsquo;s going to
      connect when he&rsquo;s loaded with about seventeen hot dinners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next moment a white streak came into the alcove, took half a dozen
      orders and darted back into the kitchen with a tray-load of empty dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It advertises the hotel,&rdquo; explained the talkative guest. &ldquo;Men come here
      from far and near to see the White Ghost razoo up and down the stretch,
      but for me I&rsquo;d rather have more waiters and less slamming. It keeps me
      nervous, and when I&rsquo;m nervous I can&rsquo;t do justice to my vittles. I&rsquo;m all
      the time expecting to see that man that&rsquo;s doomed to get <i>his</i> get it.
      It&rsquo;ll be a mighty mushy affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the White Ghost was back and was scaling loaded dishes about
      the table with a deftness that a quick dealer shows in a poker game.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I, still blind to what Fate was preparing for my side of the case, was
      merely irritated by this tophet-te-larrup!
    </p>
    <p>
      When supper was over we seized an opportunity when the White Ghost was on
      an outward trip and escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      I advised the judge that he&rsquo;d better take the key and go to our room and
      get into bed, and the old man accepted that advice with a sigh of
      thankfulness. He looked bent, weary, and broken as he climbed the stairs;
      homesick hopelessness showed in every line of his face and in every motion
      of his body. I did pity him then!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old father of the girl with the two bright eyes,&rdquo; I said, not
      realizing that I had spoken aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man sidled up and prodded me with his thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard what you said to the old gent just now! Where did you get your
      tip, pard?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had already forgotten just what the driver had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t let it out if you don&rsquo;t want to. But there&rsquo;s a little inside
      guessing in these parts and when you hear a man let drop anything about
      the &lsquo;Two Bright Eyes,&rsquo; it&rsquo;s reckoned he has had a hunch of some kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about that mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;keep it sly! But see here, pard, I&rsquo;m going to test you
      out a little on this thing. I&rsquo;ve got a few thousand shares of the old
      stock. Took it over in a poker game a long time ago&mdash;we gamble mining
      stocks out this way when we&rsquo;re busted. I&rsquo;m busted now&mdash;and they won&rsquo;t
      take mining stock at the roulette wheel. I&rsquo;ll sell you five hundred shares
      of &lsquo;Bright Eyes&rsquo; at fifty cents a share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He peered anxiously into my face as he made the offer. He was plainly
      trying to get a hint from my expression, but he didn&rsquo;t, of course. I knew
      nothing about mining stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want it.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five cents a share, then. I want to chase the wheel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on a wrong lead, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then a man bumped against me as if by accident and promptly
      apologized. It was the stage-driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The owner of the stock scowled and backed into the crowd in the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was trying to jolt a little hoss sense into you,&rdquo; explained the driver.
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you buy that stock? I passed the hunch to you to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any money for wildcatting in gold-mines,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man came close to me and spoke low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember what I said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but grabbing gold-mine stock from the first comer&mdash;say, my
      friend, do I look as green as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hish! Don&rsquo;t rear up, sir! Please don&rsquo;t! But I know that fellow who just
      tried to sell. He&rsquo;s fresh in from the hills. He doesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going
      on&mdash;and only a few do know. But I carry men on my stage who talk and
      don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m overhearing. I say no more! But I hope you&rsquo;ll take the
      hint. If I could rake and scrape another dollar I&rsquo;d buy that stock myself.
      That fellow has some kind of a hunch&mdash;but he has been too far away in
      the hills to know anything special. I guess he just smells it in the air.
      There isn&rsquo;t much stock in &lsquo;Bright Eyes&rsquo; left loose these days. I have
      smelt around; I know! That tells a long story, sir. If that fellow hadn&rsquo;t
      been off in the hills they&rsquo;d have got his away from him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was urgent and appealing. I couldn&rsquo;t understand this special interest
      in me and I told him so plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly know, either,&rdquo; he said, unabashed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking it over
      and I&rsquo;ll tell you when I get it thought out. Maybe it&rsquo;s your style. I have
      always hoped to be able to wear a suit of clothes like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He surveyed me with candid admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      My tartness didn&rsquo;t bother him a bit. He beamed on me&mdash;and plainly had
      taken a few drinks. I asked the driver to tell me how I could reach the
      mayor&rsquo;s store. My friend offered to conduct me. I had resolved to throw up
      my Breed City earthworks!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I take a liking to a gent I don&rsquo;t do nothing by halves,&rdquo; declared my
      guide when we were on our way. &ldquo;You come unwrapped enough to-day so that I
      could see that you&rsquo;ve got real whalebone in your stock and silk in your
      snapper&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the kind of a whip for my hand! You come along
      with me and I&rsquo;ll introduce you to the mayor. Him and me are chums. He
      ain&rsquo;t none of your stuck-up dudes. I&rsquo;ll tell him you&rsquo;re a special friend
      of mine. There&rsquo;s nothing like getting in right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left me in the back office of a dry-goods store, sitting knees to knees
      in the tiny room with a fat and placid man who smiled amiably and seemed
      to be impressed by my dress and demeanor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He launched out at me in a way that was surely astonishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the kind we like to see coming into our new and growing city. We
      are anxious for a touch of the dignity and refinement of the East here in
      our midst. We hope we can offer you inducements which will wean you from
      that East which, though its traditions are glorious and its civilization
      is sublime, is nevertheless a bit&mdash;I may say, without offense, I
      trust&mdash;effete&rdquo; By the way in which Mayor David Ware smacked his lips
      over that sentence I was pretty sure that he was quoting from his
      inaugural address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to have you feel that way toward me, coming here a
      stranger, Mr. Mayor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But strangers are certified to a man of insight by the masonry of
      breeding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him again and proceeded to a matter of business connected with
      my earthworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him of the plans of one Dragg, as I had gleaned them from
      accidental association with that individual. I said that Dragg had now
      attached to himself two blacklegs and undoubtedly would soon arrive in
      Breed City for the purpose of taking advantage of technicalities in the
      land law, jumping claims, holding up enterprises, giving Breed City a
      black eye outside as a municipality where titles were not assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a spy, a tattletale, or a meddler,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But this matter was
      forced on my attention when I was on my way here, and I did not want to
      see a hustling mayor and city set back by the schemes of blacklegs. I had
      heard of your city and of you, and I said to myself, &lsquo;If warning will
      enable such a city to head off a plot and put the plotters where they
      belong I&rsquo;ll hurry to headquarters with my information.&rsquo; Those men are now
      in Royal City and are on their way here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mayor&rsquo;s mild eyes bulged and his face showed his dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain you are a friend who wouldn&rsquo;t take advantage of our situation,
      sir. That&rsquo;s shown because you are not trying to operate on the tip this
      crook gave you. So I&rsquo;m going to be frank with you, as a friend. We were so
      anxious to get things moving here that we took a lot for granted in the
      matter of land titles Those men can make trouble&mdash;or at least they
      could have made trouble if we had not been warned in season by you. You
      will find that this city can be grateful, Mr. Mann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was sticking to my assumed name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you allow me to make a suggestion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly will. I&rsquo;ll be glad to have your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t undertake to jump on them, officially, the moment they strike town.
      In order to have your proof you must wait until they try to operate. Have
      them watched sharply. If you&rsquo;ll give me permission to take a hand in the
      matter, on the side, I may be able to bluff them out entirely. I reckon
      it&rsquo;s for the interests of your city to close the thing up without the
      public knowing there&rsquo;s any doubt about land titles. Of course I don&rsquo;t need
      to suggest to you that you make a flying start now and straighten out your
      law and titles so that no other shysters can come along making trouble
      after we get rid of these gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch me in that line,&rdquo; declared the mayor, thumping his breast. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      right about handling them with gloves, Mr. Mann. I tell you if you can do
      anything to help us you will stand mighty high with me and with Breed
      City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In handling them I may be able to make it seem like a personal quarrel
      between them and myself,&rdquo; I suggested. My horizon was growing wider all
      the time. &ldquo;They are dangerous men, but I&rsquo;m not afraid of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want you to be a martyr.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of them, I say. If trouble does happen here and it seems
      like a personal quarrel, you will understand it all, Mr. Mayor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may seem strange to have a stranger come along like this and offer to
      meddle in matters where he has no personal interest. Those men are nothing
      to me, one way or the other. But I&rsquo;m for fair play always!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Honor warmed to this modest candor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The city is behind you in whatever you may do in this thing, sir. As
      mayor I say it. You&rsquo;ll be backed to the limit. And if you get hurt while
      you are trying to do a bit of a trick for us I&rsquo;ll be scissored if I don&rsquo;t
      toss law and order up for a little while and organize a lynching party and
      head it in person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I thought it would come to that I wouldn&rsquo;t meddle in the affair! The
      only reason I am offering my services is because I hope to be able to keep
      Breed City from suffering a setback.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hand &rsquo;em any jolt that&rsquo;s coming to &rsquo;em in the name of Breed
      City and its mayor.&rdquo; His Honor clapped his hand on my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I trudged back to the hotel in a fairly comfortable frame of mind. It&rsquo;s a
      lucky general who can choose his own battle-field, get to it well ahead of
      the enemy, throw up earthworks and set a big gun or two in position. So, I
      said to myself, &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em come!&rdquo;

      XXI&mdash;THE SKIRMISH-LINE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> WAS a bit
      embarrassed next morning and wondered if I hadn&rsquo;t overdone the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was waited on by a delegation in the crowded office of the Pride of the
      Prairie. Mayor David Ware headed the delegation and he introduced the
      half-dozen amiable gentlemen as leading members of the Breed City Chamber
      of Commerce. Then the mayor pulled me aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand that I haven&rsquo;t whispered a word of what you and I talked
      about last night. That&rsquo;s to be buried between you and me, but there&rsquo;s
      nothing like getting in sneck with the big boys of this town. It&rsquo;ll be
      easier for me when I have to back you up&mdash;if it comes to that. I&rsquo;ve
      explained that you&rsquo;re a friend of mine who is West looking for prospects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to be called a friend of yours&mdash;and you told the truth
      about my business here, Mr Mayor. We start on a square basis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the mayor, followed by the delegation, I was escorted through the
      main street of Breed City It seemed to afford the gentlemen honest
      gratification to follow along behind that plug-hat which I had freshly
      slicked that morning to the best of my ability. I was lunched at the
      Chamber of Commerce&mdash;a half-finished board structure; I was dined by
      the mayor at his own home; and I returned to the hotel in the evening to
      find the judge marooned in the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t scowl at me that way,&rdquo; I pleaded, humbly. &ldquo;I was afraid you
      might drop something that would queer the whole proposition. You are
      looking over your shoulder as if you expected damnation to jump on to your
      back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damnation <i>is</i> getting ready to jump on to our backs,&rdquo; growled the
      old man. &ldquo;One of &rsquo;em has got here. He came in on the stage
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scalawag with the flashy clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had looked for pretty quick action, but &ldquo;Peacock&rdquo; Pratt had got away
      sooner than I expected he would. He had been free with his money, I
      concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got down-stairs early the next morning, the judge tagging at my heels.
      But we were not ahead of Mr. Pratt. I didn&rsquo;t have to hunt for him. He
      stood out like Jeff Dawlin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Peruvian cockatoo&rdquo; would have shown up in a
      flock of crows. He followed us into the diningroom, and sat down at the
      same table and scowled at me with ugly fire in his little eyes above their
      pouches of flesh. Then he leaned across the table. We three were alone
      when the White Ghost had frisked away after our breakfasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see you,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dog-eyed liar! You didn&rsquo;t expect to see me. You thought you had
      the three of us canned till you could put something across here. It cost
      me a hundred dollars to grease the lock of that calaboose&mdash;and at
      that I couldn&rsquo;t bring out the other two. But they&rsquo;re coming! You needn&rsquo;t
      worry any about that part, you punk-faced Piute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dove a pudgy hand down into the breast pocket of his vest. He got his
      wallet out and banged it down on the table. It was a big wallet and it was
      well stuffed. Judge Kingsley gulped when he saw it and his hands worked
      like claws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m heeled, and I&rsquo;ll spend it getting you, if it comes to
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He packed the big wallet back into his waistcoat, galloped down his eggs
      and bacon, and then banged away from the table. He called back over his
      shoulder, &ldquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t promised that I&rsquo;d anchor you and wait for &rsquo;em,
      else I&rsquo;d take you now and settle my breakfast with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see that money?&rdquo; gasped the old man. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my money, There&rsquo;s a
      lot of it. My God! I could hardly keep my hands off it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a nice, fat wallet, Judge Kingsley. I was glad to see it. It all
      looks very encouraging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Encouraging! Where do you see any encouragement? Two more men coming full
      of blood and thunder to join him&mdash;and you waiting here for them to
      get along! Anybody with sense would have that man grabbed by the police on
      my charges. I thought you told me you were bringing me out here to make
      the complaint? Now you&rsquo;re only dillydallying. A man with, sense, I say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I suppose a man with sense would never have come out here, at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I went out and stood on the hotel porch, my friend, the stage-driver,
      lounged up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve knocked off for a few days&rsquo; vacation,&rdquo; he explained, sociably. &ldquo;Sent
      another man for my trip to Royal City yesterday. Mud was getting on to my
      nerves. You noticed how it was the day you rode out with me. I came nigh
      queering myself with you and spoiling one of the pleasantest friendships I
      ever made. I was mighty glad to see the mayor and the boys taking you
      around town yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him I appreciated his regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another reason why I&rsquo;m taking a few days off,&rdquo; he confided. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      got a hunch that &lsquo;Dirty-shirt&rsquo; Maddox is about due here. And in the case
      of &lsquo;Dirty-shirt&rsquo; Maddox it&rsquo;s needful to be Johnny-on-the-spot when he hits
      town if I&rsquo;m going to cash in on that grubstake I advanced to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I handed him a cigar and he explained further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I ain&rsquo;t here to clap a hand over his mouth to keep the rum out and the
      news in, he&rsquo;ll get four slugs of language-loosener into him inside of four
      minutes after striking the first board-walk here and then it&rsquo;s brakes off,
      all into a gallop and hell-bent up the rise for that &lsquo;Bright Eyes&rsquo; stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At a little distance the stylish Mr. Pratt paced his way to and fro on the
      porch, scowling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please take a good look at that fellow,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do the best I can without smoked glasses,&rdquo; promised the
      stage-driver. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him before&mdash;and I never liked his style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name is Pratt,&rdquo; I said loud enough to be heard by that gentleman. &ldquo;He
      seems to hold some kind of a grudge against me and is following me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pratt let loose a torrent of cuss words that were fully as highly
      colored as his rig-out. He wound up by saying, &ldquo;And, by the gods! I&rsquo;ll get
      you, and get you fine and plenty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you remember that?&rdquo; I asked the stage-driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      I realized that I had pretty good control of the movements of Mr. Pratt.
      For where I did go there went Pratt also. Mr. Pratt was decidedly on his
      job. Personal hatred moved him and he felt responsible, I suppose, for the
      interests of the two who were frothing behind the bars of the calaboose in
      Royal City. He seemed to be guarding me as a morsel for a feast of revenge
      at which three proposed to sit down. He stuck to me so closely that my big
      idea became firm enough to handle. The ability to move Pratt, and to be
      near Pratt at all times by Pratt&rsquo;s own wish, suggested my scheme to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the noon hour was at hand I led the way back to the hotel, and, while
      I tidied myself for dinner, taking my turn at the mirror in the wash-room,
      I had an eye for the manoeuvers of Pratt, who was preening and pluming
      himself, whisking all the stains of outdoors from his clothing, settling
      his gorgeous tie, smoothing his waistcoat across his expansive front.
    </p>
    <p>
      I couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;I grinned in his face when I thought of my plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      I buttoned my frock-coat carefully and started for the dining-room&mdash;and
      Pratt followed close. On the threshold I cast a look within. The White
      Ghost was not there&mdash;he was in eclipse in the kitchen for the moment.
      I started through the big hall, toward the alcove, crossing near the swing
      doors. Pratt came on behind me and I halted and turned suddenly on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to shoot you now and here in your tracks, where every one can
      look on,&rdquo; I told him in a whisper&mdash;and I kept smiling. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      dare to pull a gun. I&rsquo;ve got you covered. I&rsquo;ve got a revolver in that hand
      that&rsquo;s wrapped in the tail of this coat and it&rsquo;s aimed at you. I&rsquo;m going
      to shoot you while I&rsquo;m smiling. There are men looking at me. I&rsquo;ll say that
      the gun went off by accident. It&rsquo;ll be believed, because we look so
      sociable. Hold on! Don&rsquo;t you open that mouth to yell. You&rsquo;ve got one
      chance for your life. I&rsquo;ll tell you now&mdash;because I&rsquo;ll never have a
      better chance to get you proper if you don&rsquo;t take that chance I offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was stalling then, for I had not intended to talk so long. Mr. Pratt
      stood there as stiff as a wooden man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a peep at my hand that was muffled in the skirt of my frock-coat.
      The unseen terrifies most. His face grew pale. He continued-to stare at
      the hidden thing that threatened his life. My smile broadened&mdash;it was
      no assumed smile&mdash;for my wrapped hand was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may think that this is a queer place for me to hold you up&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Pratt could have known what was passing in my mind at that moment he
      would have agreed. It would also have astonished Mr. Pratt to know that I
      was just then raking my soul in order to think of something to say next.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be an infernally long time between the shuttlings of the
      White Ghost. I felt like an anarchist who has timed a bomb and finds his
      fuse faulty. Where in the devil&rsquo;s name was the fool? I knew I couldn&rsquo;t
      stand there and tell a serial story to Pratt. A dangerous light was coming
      into the man&rsquo;s eyes. Astonishment had held him for the first few moments,
      then fear had chained him, but finally panic was plainly breaking out in
      him, and in such cases a victim will run amuck regardless of consequences.
      I felt that Pratt was getting ready to howl and leap upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was the White Ghost?
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought came to me that this prolonged absence hinted at one
      consolation&mdash;the White Ghost must be filling many orders&mdash;his
      tray would be heaped to the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your one chance is&mdash;&rdquo; said I&mdash;and then it happened!
    </p>
    <p>
      Without warning, the swing doors burst open under the kick of the White
      Ghost&rsquo;s foot and forth from the cavern of the kitchen came the
      thunderbolt. I had been waiting and listening, and was ready to dodge. The
      petrified Pratt never stirred a stump. There was a howl from warning
      diners&mdash;a collision, a terrific crash, and Pratt went down under the
      avalanche. The White Ghost was lugging one of the biggest loads of his
      career. There were deep plates in which hot and greasy soup swam, there
      were gravied meats, nappies of vegetables, tea, coffee, macaroni, pies,
      and puddings. Mr. Pratt was buried under dishes, hot soup blinded his
      eyes, macaroni was twined around his neck, pies plastered his shirt bosom,
      and his clothes sopped up liquids. He might have been labeled, &ldquo;A dinner
      in eruption!&rdquo; The White Ghost dove across him and skated along the floor
      on his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hurried to Pratt and began to paw the dishes from off him. And having
      planned just what I was going to do and knowing just where to seek for
      what I wanted, I dove a hand into Pratt&rsquo;s inside vest pocket and yanked
      out the big wallet. Other men ran to help me, there was excitement, and in
      that mess of provisions which I was cuffing to right and left my handling
      of the wallet was noticed by no one. I was kneeling close beside Pratt and
      I shoved the wallet between my knees, and when I arose, slid it up under
      my coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were plenty of volunteers whose hands were out to boost Mr. Pratt to
      his feet. His eyes were tightly shut and he was bellowing about the pain
      the soup was giving him. I took the rôle of close friend and ordered the
      rescuers to carry Mr. Pratt to the wash-room and give him first aid with
      towels and water. I followed close upon their heels and elbowed Kingsley
      along with the push. The judge had stood at some distance during our
      drama. I pulled his hand up under my coat and set it on the wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grab it!&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;Slip it under your coat; get out of this hotel
      and around the corner. Jam the money into your stocking and stamp the
      wallet down into the mud. Be careful no one sees you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was on me that Pratt&rsquo;s eyes first opened&mdash;for I was swabbing the
      soup out of those eyes with the end of a wet towel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he opened his mouth I swabbed the towel across his lips. Other
      volunteers were working away at the clothing of the victim with wet
      towels.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once Pratt began to slap himself on the breast and howl. His
      laments in regard to the hot soup in his eyes had been loud, but in
      contrast to his latest outburst they were as the voice of the chickadee
      compared with the roar of the lion. After he had beat upon his breast, he
      dove a greasy hand into his vest pocket. It was empty. His eyes goggled,
      his face grew purple, he shouted, he swore, and he raved.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been done, trimmed, robbed, frisked, touched&mdash;so were his
      bellowings! He searched his soul for synonyms with which to announce to
      the world that his wallet had been stolen. And then he accused me&mdash;accused
      me with violence and profanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just one moment, sir,&rdquo; I suggested, taking advantage of a moment when Mr.
      Pratt was choking. &ldquo;You are sure those dishes didn&rsquo;t crack your skull a
      bit and injure your brain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After spitting many oaths, Mr. Pratt declared that he was all right and
      knew what he was talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to back that up,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;Fifty men were looking at you
      when that thing happened. I have not been out of the sight of those men
      since. You say it was a large wallet.&rdquo; I unbuttoned my coat and slung it
      open. &ldquo;Will any gentleman present kindly search me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is going too far when he shoots off his mouth about a gent like you,&rdquo;
       declared somebody in the crowd. &ldquo;We all saw you. All you did was try to
      help the son of a gun out of his mess&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all the thanks you
      get!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistakes are bound to occur. I demand that some gentleman make sure that
      I have no wallet on my person. My own money is in a roll in my trousers
      pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A solid-looking citizen searched me, uttering apologies. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t any
      wallet on this gent, and you&rsquo;d better ask his pardon for remarks offered,&rdquo;
       suggested the citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pratt only raved the louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to say a word just here,&rdquo; called a voice. The stage-driver
      pushed to the front. &ldquo;You all know me and you know I ain&rsquo;t any liar. This
      gent, here, is a friend of mine and he wouldn&rsquo;t do dirt to anybody. He&rsquo;s a
      friend of our mayor, too.&rdquo; He put his hand affectionately on my shoulder.
      &ldquo;But as for that other cuss, there, in the piebald clothes, I heard him
      make threats not longer ago than this morning that he would get my friend,
      and get him good and plenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you think I arranged to have those seventeen dinners dumped over me
      so as to make the plot a good one, you pie-eyed horse-walloper, you,&rdquo;
       squealed Pratt, beginning to &ldquo;weave&rdquo; in his fury like a caged bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder a mite,&rdquo; replied the driver, coolly. &ldquo;When I heard you
      threatening to get my friend you was mad enough to try on most anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got my money, I tell you. I felt him at my pocket while I was trying
      to get my senses back. Blast you all for infernal fools, I&rsquo;ve been robbed
      right before your eyes and you&rsquo;re backing up the thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a stir at the door and the crowd glanced that way and parted
      respectfully. It was His Honor the Mayor of Breed City. He stood for a few
      moments and listened to the language Pratt addressed to me. Then he broke
      in with authority:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment, citizens! There&rsquo;s a lot about this affair, here, that I
      know and cannot tell. As for that knave who accuses Mr. Mann, I declare on
      my honor that he is a dangerous foe to this city. He has come here to try
      to ruin it if his scheme works.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pratt at this point managed to control the amazement that was provoked
      by the appearance of this new champion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Mayor,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got the wrong dope about me.
      Dragg tried to get me into the scheme, but I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are convicting yourself right now out of your own mouth,&rdquo; broke in
      the mayor. He marched up to Pratt, finger upraised: &ldquo;You are as dangerous
      here as a dynamite bomb. I&rsquo;ll allow you thirty minutes to get out of town.
      Get to those other two knaves and warn them that they&rsquo;ll be lynched if
      they show up here&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll lead the lynching-bee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was immediate change in Mr. Pratt&rsquo;s demeanor and the mayor and the
      bystanders listened to him. The fat face was lined with grief, and tears
      ran down his cheeks and mingled with the grub stains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not lying about that wallet, gents. I&rsquo;ve lost my bundle. It has been
      stolen. That&rsquo;s a nice word to go out about Breed City&mdash;that a visitor
      to town loses his wad and the mayor backs up the man who stole it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; said the mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll simply say that I&rsquo;ve lost my money&mdash;and how about law and
      order in a city that will let a man be trimmed in that style? Hold on one
      minute, Mr. Mayor! It isn&rsquo;t merely a case of my own money! If it was, I&rsquo;d
      shut up now and pass on. But I had along with mine the money of a good
      friend who trusted me with his roll. I left him in the calaboose back on
      the trail and I brought out his money to take care of it for him, for he
      was afraid they&rsquo;d get to him for it. That&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s truth, Mayor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a crowd there may be found champions for the under dog&mdash;even when
      a mayor has turned down his thumb. I heard murmurs. One voice suggested
      that the matter better be looked into&mdash;the good name of Breed City
      demanded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t much to say in this business, even though this man has accused
      me,&rdquo; I said in the silence that followed. &ldquo;Now that you are on the subject
      of your money, Mr. Pratt, and are making such a squeal in regard to the
      loss of it, will you allow me to ask you how much of it was money you
      stole in the East&mdash;especially from Zebulon Kingsley of Levant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If I had struck &ldquo;Peacock&rdquo; Pratt between the eyes the effect could not have
      been more noticeable. Most of those men who were present had been trained
      to gauge the human expression in that region of plain and mountain where
      life itself sometimes depends on the ability to judge between bluff and
      resolve. His fat cheeks flushed and then they grew pale. That a stranger
      in the Far West should be able to cast in his teeth one of his latest
      exploits staggered him. He tried to speak and couldn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pratt, you have twenty-two more minutes left of that half hour,&rdquo; stated
      the mayor, after silence had continued for some moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that has to go for to-day,&rdquo; said Pratt. &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t go for
      to-morrow&mdash;nor for next day if my friends and I can get back here,
      Mr. Mayor! Lynch or no lynch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He buttoned his waistcoat, took a mournful look at himself in the
      wash-room mirror, and headed for a livery-stable which a sarcastic
      bystander recommended. I knew that threat to come back wasn&rsquo;t mere talk.
      Mr. Pratt had good reason to take the risks!
    </p>
    <p>
      I took my first chance and escaped from the populace of Breed City to hunt
      up Kingsley in the little room in the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo; I was all a-tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little over six thousand dollars. Mostly five-hundred-dollar bills.
      Part of it is tied up in a separate package and marked with Dawlin&rsquo;s
      name.&rdquo; The judge was not very enthusiastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat down on the edge of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order to be on the right side and make allowance for delays here and
      there, we ought to leave here tomorrow, Judge Kingsley. And even then we&rsquo;d
      be having hours for a margin&mdash;not days. I felt pretty good when I
      heard Pratt say that he had Dawlin&rsquo;s money along. I figured there would be
      more between the two of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s all over, is it? We&rsquo;re beaten, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do <i>you</i> think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you and I have always seemed to make more progress
      when I take the opposite side in an argument. I predict that we shall win
      out. Please hand over that money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money is mine&mdash;it was stolen from me. You&rsquo;re too reckless to
      handle money. We&rsquo;re beaten, I tell you. I&rsquo;ll send that money home to my
      wife and daughter. It&rsquo;s something for them to live on. I&rsquo;ll kill myself
      out here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Kingsley put both hands over his breast pocket. He was hysterical.
      There was no reasoning with him and so I rose from the bed, walked across
      the room, and snapped a finger under his nose. Zebulon Kingsley must not
      have money in his pocket&mdash;in that case I could not handle him or
      trust him to stay with me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give&mdash;me&mdash;that&mdash;money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared and groaned and obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I divided the bills into packets, tucked them into my various pockets, and
      walked out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This money needs an airing,&rdquo; I informed the judge. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it outdoors
      and give it one. It has been in some mighty bad company.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XXII&mdash;MONEY ON THE GALLOP
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N most
      circumstances, being padded with bills to the amount of six thousand
      dollars would be comfortably warming. But in my case the possession of
      that sum only provoked irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had set out to save Zebulon Kingsley&rsquo;s name and the peace of mind of his
      family. The sum I had replevined by my scheme of justice fell far short of
      what we needed&mdash;and there was the promise I had given Dodovah Vose,
      as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the hotel porch I saw my friend, the stage-driver, humping it toward
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have tripped, tied, and gagged him. That was the only thing to do! He
      got here and he got two drinks into himself before I could slip the bridle
      on him. In another two minutes he would have been jumping clear off&rsquo;n the
      ground, head and tail up, snorting out everything he knows. But I got to
      him&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve laid him away, tied and gagged. Go to it, Mr. Mann, go
      to it, I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He certainly was some excited!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you talking about a man or a cayuse?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about
      &lsquo;Dirty-shirt&rsquo;&mdash;he&rsquo;s just in from Blacksnake Gully ahead of the news.
      Say, they&rsquo;ve struck a brown crumble in &lsquo;Bright Eyes&rsquo; with gold set into
      the mush like raisins in a drunken cook&rsquo;s pudding. You&rsquo;re a sport and a
      friend of mine. I&rsquo;m letting you in. Come along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran away a little distance and whirled and halted with the eager air of
      a dog who is inviting his master to follow. I&rsquo;ll bet if he had had long
      ears he would have perked them; if he had had a tail he would have wagged
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sport&mdash;and I know it. Come along,&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the street came loafing the individual who had tried to sell me
      &ldquo;Bright Eyes&rdquo; stock, and he heard that call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re barking up the wrong tree, pard,&rdquo; he advised the driver. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no
      sport. I have tried him out. He won&rsquo;t take a chance. I gave him a chance
      on some mining shares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shares?&rdquo; asked the stage-driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bright Eyes&rsquo; in the Blacksnake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My friend was truly a good actor. He showed no interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shift the name to &lsquo;blacked eyes.&rsquo; Yes, and both of &rsquo;em closed at
      that. No good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you there&rsquo;s something in the air,&rdquo; insisted the other. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
      fair gamble at twenty-five cents a share.&rdquo; He pulled out some papers and
      walked up to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look like ready money, my friend. I&rsquo;d rather play the wheel just now
      than be rich. I&rsquo;m tied in here by the mud and it&rsquo;s getting on to my
      nerves. Take ten thousand at twenty-five cents. I&rsquo;ll close out to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; sang out the driver, and he managed to smuggle a wink to me
      while he was tugging papers out of his pocket on his way back to join us.
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re in the market for &lsquo;Bright Eyes,&rsquo; Eastern fellow, here&rsquo;s ten
      thousand shares for fifteen cents a share.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you come butting in on my market,&rdquo; protested the prospector,
      elbowing the driver away. &ldquo;I got to this gent first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those shares have been used all over this section for counters in poker
      games when beans got too expensive,&rdquo; sneered the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prospector pulled out more papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll take twenty thousand at ten cents a share I&rsquo;ll pass &rsquo;em
      over. I was intending to hold on to ten thousand shares for a gamble. I
      tell you there&rsquo;s something, somehow, somewhere, that says the hunch is out
      for &lsquo;Bright Eyes.&rsquo; But I&rsquo;ll let go for ten cents if you&rsquo;ll take the
      bunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no better offer than you made the other night,&rdquo; I stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was pretty drunk, then, and I didn&rsquo;t mean to make it. I&rsquo;m daffy now, I
      reckon, or I wouldn&rsquo;t be doing it over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stood there and looked them over and for the first time I gave a little
      real thought to that gold-mine proposition. Up to then the matter had been
      mere sound, shooting into one ear and out the other. I had been having
      plenty to think about in other lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck me that I was being played for a sucker by a couple of mighty
      awkward amateurs. Talk about Zebulon Kingsley buying a gold brick! That
      affair had been well buttered by some slick operators. What those two
      chaps were trying on me was truly raw work. That stage-driver&mdash;I
      didn&rsquo;t even know his name&mdash;must have a healthy hate for me hidden
      deep down in him! I have cuffed a dog in my life and had him show more
      affection afterward, but I couldn&rsquo;t believe that such treatment helped to
      mellow love in a human being. I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t improve my own
      disposition any. In my thoughts I had some excuse for the two. They had
      probably been brought up to believe that the ordinary Easterner who had
      not already bought some punk gold-mine stock was thriftily saving up to
      buy some.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one of &rsquo;em born every minute,&rdquo; I remarked to the
      stage-driver, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t know I looked so much like one. Run away, the
      two of you, and fan yourselves with that stock; that&rsquo;s the only way you&rsquo;ll
      ever raise any wind with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t talking to me, are you&mdash;to me&mdash;Wash Flye?&rdquo; inquired
      the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, if that&rsquo;s your name&mdash;and it seems to fit you! But you are not
      fly enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened eyes and mouth on me, stepped back a few feet, and visibly
      swelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my-y-y Ga-a-awd!&rdquo; he wailed. &ldquo;If that ain&rsquo;t using the butt end of
      the whip on a willing friend, may I never sort webbin&rsquo;s again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was truly something sincere in his distress. But that sudden
      warming-up to me on the prairie after I had manhandled him, his
      unaccountable friendliness, his jacking his job for a few days in order to
      dog me about Breed City&mdash;the whole thing was too openly a plant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good actor. No wonder you&rsquo;re in the stage business, Flye,&rdquo; was
      my poor joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me for a full minute. Then he turned on the other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, you horn-gilled wump, with your sashay prices and your drunken
      man&rsquo;s gab&mdash;it&rsquo;s you that has put me in wrong with a friend,&rdquo; he
      squealed. &ldquo;He thinks I&rsquo;m like you are! He thinks I&rsquo;m in mush with you on a
      brace! I&rsquo;ll show him and you!&rdquo; He leaped forward and began to kick the
      prospector with fury. The latter was a big and rather torpid person and he
      seemed to be in a sort of daze at first, and stood still while Mr. Flye
      kicked him. Then he turned and knocked Mr. Flye down; he picked him up and
      knocked him down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck me that if this were acting between friends it was getting too
      realistic. The driver&rsquo;s face was bloody and he lay where he fell, his eyes
      closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I jumped between and pushed the prospector away. He struck at me and I was
      obliged to hit him a clip or two before he would hold off. We had a fairly
      good audience, but fisticuffs in Breed, when the muddy season made tempers
      short, seemed to stir only mild interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Mr. Flye on his knees and &ldquo;weaving&rdquo; weakly when I turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no fighter&mdash;I don&rsquo;t pretend to be a fighter,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;I
      knew he was going to lick me if I kicked him. But that&rsquo;s all right!
      There&rsquo;s three teeth loose and my eyes are bunging! I can feel &rsquo;em!
      But it&rsquo;s all right. If anybody thinks it was a scuffle between friends,
      he&rsquo;d better take another think. I&rsquo;ve took a licking to show some folks
      that there&rsquo;s such a thing as being mistook in a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hadn&rsquo;t straightened out my opinions, exactly, but I felt sudden pity and
      new respect for Mr. Flye, and some emotion even deeper. I helped him to
      his feet and took him into the wash-room of the hotel and fixed him up as
      best I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you so very much,&rdquo; he kept assuring me, whimpering through
      his bruised and bleeding lips. &ldquo;It probably hasn&rsquo;t seemed natural to you&mdash;it
      hasn&rsquo;t seemed natural to me. This world is full of crooks and I s&rsquo;pose
      you&rsquo;ve been up against a lot of &rsquo;em. I done one crooked thing
      myself once when I kept water away from a drove of hogs for two days and
      then let &rsquo;em drink all they could hold just before I sold &rsquo;em
      live weight to a Snake River drover. But that drover had stolen two
      cayuses off&rsquo;n my uncle! I didn&rsquo;t know what I could do to show you, sir!
      Probably what I have done don&rsquo;t show you. But I&rsquo;ve done my best. It was
      all I could think of on short notice. I&rsquo;ll let a dozen men beat me up if
      you will only understand that I ain&rsquo;t going to do you or try to do you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That spirit of humble martyrdom was certainly getting to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Mr Flye,&rdquo; I blurted, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand at all. Why in blazes
      are you taking all this interest in me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at me out of those pathetic, pale-blue eyes around which
      blue-black circles were settling. It was a lingering and wistful gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. It came over me all of a sudden. It ain&rsquo;t often I take
      to anybody. It just came over me. You&rsquo;re a real gent&mdash;you knowed just
      how to handle me. You know how to handle me now! Ain&rsquo;t you doing the
      friendly act, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were alone in the wash-room; the guests of the hotel flocked there only
      at meal-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can see how it looked to me&mdash;a stranger here&mdash;you two
      fellows chasing me up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you, sir,&rdquo; he agreed, meekly. &ldquo;This world is full of
      crooks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some money with me. It isn&rsquo;t mine. I need more in a hurry&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      to save a man&rsquo;s name&mdash;save him from death, perhaps!&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t hold
      in. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to save his daughter, too. I&rsquo;m in love with her. I have been for
      years! It&rsquo;s all I can think about. When you spoke of &lsquo;Bright Eyes&rsquo; I felt&mdash;I
      felt&mdash;&rdquo; I stopped and gulped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I know how you feel,&rdquo; stated Mr. Flye, wagging that mussed-up
      head of his. &ldquo;I know a girl. There&rsquo;s hardly a minute when I ain&rsquo;t thinking
      about her. She hasn&rsquo;t paid no attention to me, but I&rsquo;m going to her after
      I make my clean-up on &lsquo;Bright Eyes&rsquo;! It makes &rsquo;em think twice when
      there&rsquo;s money. I ain&rsquo;t much&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m desperate&mdash;I&rsquo;m half crazy, Flye! This mine! Are you fooling me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He straightened and put his hand up like a man taking the oath. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted you to get in because I liked you, sir. That&rsquo;s why I was after
      you. But now that you say that you need money I&rsquo;m begging and imploring
      you! If money will do what you say it will in your case, I say &rsquo;fore
      God you&rsquo;ll commit a sin if you don&rsquo;t grab in! I know it! It has come.
      &lsquo;Dirty-shirt&rsquo; don&rsquo;t know how to lie about it. The strike has been made.
      Take my word,&rdquo; he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re trying to do an honest turn
      for me.&rdquo; I put out my hand and he took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank the Lord!&rdquo; he said, and there was a lot of manliness about Mr. Wash
      Flye at that moment. &ldquo;That licking was a good investment.&rdquo; He said it
      devoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will that fellow sell now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you handle his twenty thousand shares at ten cents&mdash;two thousand
      dollars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I offered at fifteen I was trying to beat him down to ten. Don&rsquo;t
      give a cent more. Go show him the money and say you&rsquo;re willing to be
      buncoed once in your life. And hurry&mdash;for the love of Sancho, hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I found the prospector watching a roulette game with the sour gaze of a
      busted gambler. He went into the corner with me when I jerked invitation
      with my chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my mind,&rdquo; he growled, when I mentioned the stock. &ldquo;And I
      wouldn&rsquo;t do business with you anyway, you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I unfolded four five-hundred-dollar bills. He stopped his declaration as
      suddenly as if I had pinched his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money is money, I suppose,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;though your shin-plasters from the
      East are poor things alongside the good hard coin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the bank across the street, and they&rsquo;ll give you the good hard
      coin, mister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled out his packet and I verified the amount of the certificates.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to the bank in his company, for he seemed to be bothered with the
      notion that those five-hundred-dollar bills needed me as introducer and
      sponsor. Then he hotfooted out, weighted with the coin. In spite of myself
      and of my fresh faith in Mr. Flye, my heart sank considerably when I saw
      that money take legs. The cashier was one of the amiable citizens I had
      met in the delegation from the Chamber of Commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Making a little investment?&rdquo; he inquired, sociably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A foolish one, I am afraid. But an Easterner who hasn&rsquo;t had a flier in a
      gold-mine at least once in his life gets to feeling lonesome after a time.
      That chap has been chasing me around with stock and a story and I have
      tossed a little spare change to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cashier peered through the wicket and beamed with new respect on a man
      who could speak of two thousand dollars as spare change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are mines&mdash;and then there are mines,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought I might as well try my new tune over on this piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a proposition called &lsquo;Two Bright Eyes.&rdquo; I tried to seem indifferent,
      but my heart was only about an inch below my larynx and I could hardly get
      the words out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought he would never speak. He scratched his nose and fiddled with his
      ear. I wanted to reach in and shake him so that he would say something,
      even if he would only say that I had been nicely fooled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The property had rather a promising outlook at one time, sir. It was
      located by good prospectors and afterward two or three other claims were
      taken in. The section is first-rate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not wildly encouraging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the stock hasn&rsquo;t been much thought of in these parts&mdash;it has
      been footballed around a lot. Still&rdquo;&mdash;he twisted his mustache and
      waited a few moments&mdash;&ldquo;well, I&rsquo;ll tell you this confidentially, if I
      wasn&rsquo;t a bank man&mdash;and you know we have to move in grooves of caution&mdash;if
      I could afford to do a little gambling I think I would have picked up a
      small bunch of this loose stock. I got a flicker of a hint from a mining
      engineer who banks here. Nothing definite&mdash;they can&rsquo;t talk much. But
      I know they have been running new leads. The first development wasn&rsquo;t very
      scientific, I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does a&mdash;When they make a real strike&mdash;do prices run up pretty
      sudden?&rdquo; I managed to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. &ldquo;I see you have never been in a mining town when a bonanza
      toots. Everybody goes crazy. They&rsquo;ll climb over one another to buy stock.
      Those who can&rsquo;t buy stock go racing off to see what they can grab in the
      way of adjacent claims. Very exciting, sir! Wish we might show you a
      circus of that kind while you&rsquo;re in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I went out on the street I found Mr. Flye waiting around the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You traded?&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s over there tossing away twenty-dollar gold
      pieces!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got twenty thousand shares,&rdquo; I said, dolefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going to let &lsquo;Dirty-shirt&rsquo; loose. He&rsquo;ll swell up and bust if I
      don&rsquo;t get that gag out of his mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will anybody believe what he says?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Honestly, a gold-mine was unreal to me! I had Eastern prejudices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go over there and stand on the hotel porch, sir! You&rsquo;ll see almighty
      sudden how news hits a mining town. &lsquo;Dirty-shirt&rsquo; Maddox don&rsquo;t have to
      bring a gold-mine down into Breed City. He&rsquo;s the bulletin, that&rsquo;s all.
      There&rsquo;ll be proof enough pretty close on his heels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I went over on the tavern porch. Five minutes later I realized that the
      bulletin was loose. &ldquo;It&rdquo; came whooping around a corner of the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Maddox&rsquo;s nickname fitted him perfectly; in fact, he was well caked
      with mud from head to feet. Plainly he had not stopped to pick dry spots
      in his rush down to Breed City. He was shaking a canvas bag over his head
      with one hand and in the other flourished a handful of stock certificates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s got &lsquo;Bright Eyes&rsquo;? They&rsquo;ve hit it! High grade from Buffalo Hump
      clear through the earth to Chiny! Whoosh! Who wants &lsquo;Bright Eyes&rsquo;? Here&rsquo;s
      some that&rsquo;s loose. And there ain&rsquo;t much loose, gents! They have been
      picking it up! High grade and pockets full of crumble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook the canvas bag and opened it when men went crowding about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; announced Mr. Flye at my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks the part,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After I had rubbed his jaws where the gag had hurt,&rdquo; confided my friend,
      &ldquo;he told me that he ain&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n four jumps ahead of the boss engineer
      expert who is bringing out the samples for the report. All you&rsquo;ve got to
      do now, sir, is to sit tight and look wise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My unlucky friend could not do much looking for his part; his eyes were
      swelled so badly that he could hardly open them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Mr. Flye,&rdquo; I said, with a lot of repentance, &ldquo;I must seem to
      you like pretty much of a crab. I don&rsquo;t know how&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only a gold-mine guess, according to your notion, sir. And I know
      how an Easterner must feel on that point. But when I have a friend and
      make up my mind to let him in on a good thing I propose to do it, even if
      I have to apologize to him afterward for being almighty fresh. So I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me feel worse than I am feeling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a crowd in the street of Breed City by that time and Mr. Maddox,
      in the center of it, had worked himself into a frenzy of excitement and
      was offering &ldquo;Bright Eyes&rdquo; stock at a million dollars a share.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind that kind of talk,&rdquo; advised Mr. Flye. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s half tight, and
      his coco ain&rsquo;t just right when he gets to talking in a crowd, but you
      needn&rsquo;t worry but what his news is all right. And you can see for
      yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several men were larruping cayuses up the street, bags dangling from
      saddle-bows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first of the rush for the &lsquo;Bright Eyes&rsquo; section. Some of the
      critters out this way can beat firemen for quick action,&rdquo; stated Mr. Flye.
      Perhaps to emphasize the fact that now at last he felt himself on a
      footing of intimate friendship with me, he plucked a cigar from my vest
      pocket and lighted up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you don&rsquo;t smoke&mdash;you probably chaw,&rdquo; he suggested, and he
      handed his plug to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I state here that I promptly took the plug, whittled off a chunk,
      palmed it, and put some gum into my mouth, the depth of my esteem for Mr.
      Flye may be understood. I would rather have chewed that tobacco than hurt
      his feelings by refusing a friendly offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we stood there a bearded man rode down the street, mud-covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the man who will back me up!&rdquo; squealed Maddox. &ldquo;There comes
      the boss engineer! He knows what&rsquo;s under cover in &lsquo;Bright Eyes&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the bearded man rode right through the crowd without answering
      questions. He alighted in front of the bank and went in, tugging something
      in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a new, and somewhat heavy, stockholder in &ldquo;Bright Eyes&rdquo; gold-mine, I
      reckoned I&rsquo;d try to get a little information from that engineer&mdash;I
      was quite sure that an Eastern capitalist who wore a silk hat and had a
      friend in the bank cashier might expect a little more attention than a
      street bystander. Therefore, with a word to my friend Flye I went over to
      find out the best or the worst.

    <h2>
      XXIII&mdash;THE CLEAN-UP
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>FTER I had been
      properly indorsed by the cashier, the mining engineer gave me some mighty
      comforting information, though I did not understand the technical lingo
      very well. He was conservative; he was not at all excited. We could hear
      &ldquo;Dirty-shirt&rdquo; still orating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course that old lunatic doesn&rsquo;t know what he is talking about,&rdquo; said
      the engineer. &ldquo;There are always some of that sort to run and rant and stir
      up excitement and start poor fools off on a wild-goose chase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened a sack and showed me ore and hunks of crumbly rock which looked
      like nothing special. I had rather expected to see nuggets. He explained
      that the crumbly stuff was high grade, very much so, but there were only
      scattered pockets of it in the &ldquo;Bright Eyes&rdquo; claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The parties who first located the property,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;simply skim in for
      what pockets they were able to open. They had to pack all their ore out on
      cayuses and ship it to Tacoma, and there was no profit to speak of unless
      the ore yielded over a couple hundred dollars a ton. So when they quit the
      job the mine seemed to be played out.&rdquo; Then he went on with his technical
      talk, and about all I could do was to blink and try to look wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can be sure that Newell knows what he is talking about,&rdquo; put in the
      cashier.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wished <i>I</i> knew. I wanted to butt in with some excited questions.
      &lsquo;But I did understand that the men who had gathered up most of the stock
      of the mine were going to build a smelter and tackle the thing right end
      to. There was plenty of ore and the mine would pay after development was
      the comforting information handed to me at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, but how many shares went to you in that trade you just
      made?&rdquo; asked the cashier. &ldquo;That is, if you&rsquo;re willing to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty thousand&mdash;I bought for ten cents a share.&rdquo; The engineer
      showed some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think so much of the loose stuff was corralled in one bunch; we
      thought what we hadn&rsquo;t picked up was scattered so wide that we wouldn&rsquo;t
      bother to chase it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;How did you happen to grab in on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t propose to betray Mr. Flye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it was just a gamble! A fellow kept following around after me and I
      bought to get rid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of you Eastern Yankees certainly can use your noses for something
      else than to talk through,&rdquo; said the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I smelled a bargain when I bought that stock I reckon it must have
      been hunch instead of knowledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, stick by and stand your assessment for the smelter and you won&rsquo;t be
      sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayor Ware and several other citizens came hurrying to have the news about
      &ldquo;Bright Eyes&rdquo; confirmed. I stood at one side for a time, listening and
      meditating. When the cashier told them of my lucky strike they were
      immensely tickled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know we Easterners never can make a goldmine seem real,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In most cases where they&rsquo;re selling stock East the mines are not real.
      But you&rsquo;re West, now, and you happened in on the ground floor,&rdquo; said the
      mayor. &ldquo;I am sorry I&rsquo;m not there, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can be,&rdquo; I promptly informed him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m called back home. I&rsquo;m in a
      hurry. I don&rsquo;t know anything about gold-mines. I can&rsquo;t come back here to
      watch my interests. You folks out here know all about mines and values. My
      stock is for sale if anybody wants it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What price?&rdquo; inquired the mayor. &ldquo;We might make up a little syndicate.
      How much do you want for the stock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I confessed, frankly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all new to me. I paid ten
      cents a share. When a gold-mine gets to paying I don&rsquo;t know how much it
      pays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends on the mine,&rdquo; stated the engineer. &ldquo;We can do a pretty good
      job of guessing in our line, but we can&rsquo;t see all that&rsquo;s underground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I pulled out my packet of stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you honestly, gentlemen, this seems more or less like a joke to me&mdash;and
      that being the case I&rsquo;ll sell cheap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really worth par&mdash;or it will be in time, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; stated the
      mayor, in honest fashion. &ldquo;We are under great obligations to you, sir, and
      we don&rsquo;t want to take advantage of you in any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I feel just that same way toward you, gentlemen,&rdquo; I assured them.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always the element of a gamble in mining, I&rsquo;m sure, though I
      don&rsquo;t know much about it. Your mine may flush out. I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll
      do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll meet you on a half-way basis. I&rsquo;ll sell for half price&mdash;fifty
      cents on a dollar. Give me ten thousand dollars and you own the stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stepped aside and conferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll be in town a few days longer!&rdquo; suggested the mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can get out of here to-night I want to go. I must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say again, we don&rsquo;t want to take any advantage of you because you are
      obliged to leave in such a hurry. This may seem like queer talk for
      business men to make&mdash;to offer more than the price asked. But we want
      you to remember that Breed City is grateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really am not asking for any presents,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was jackass talk for me to make, and I knew it. Lord! we needed all
      the money we could scrape. But a funny sort of pride swelled up in me. I
      did not propose to be outdone in politeness. Never had I had municipal
      attentions shown to my humble self before I came to Breed City. They did
      not realize all the good it had done me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is no proposition of that sort,&rdquo; declared the mayor. &ldquo;But we are so
      sure of Newell&rsquo;s judgment that we know we shall make big profits on this
      stock. There are six of us. We propose to give you twelve thousand
      dollars, so that the amount you have paid for the stock will be handed
      back to you also. We&rsquo;d like you to remember that Breed City was good to
      you to the extent of ten thousand dollars&rsquo; clear profit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That asinine pride was prompting me to split the difference with them. But
      across the street just then I saw the old judge peering about, evidently
      in a panic of anxiety about me because I had been gone so long with all
      that money. Another memory jogged me at that moment. I was morally bound
      to hand Dodovah Vose some profit on his five hundred dollars. Haggling
      with those enthusiastic citizens of Breed would be feeding my fool pride
      at the expense of two old men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trade, gentlemen, with all thanks to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mayor was president of the bank and I guess the rest were directors;
      at any rate, the cashier, in about two minutes, was asking me how I would
      have it!
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked for currency&mdash;big bills. I had a boyish, eager hankering to
      lug the money to the judge, to show it to him, to have him count it and
      feel it and know that he could face the taxpayers of Levant, even if he
      couldn&rsquo;t satisfy all his creditors. But even bankruptcy, thought I, was
      not State prison; my uncle would be cheated out of that part of his
      revenge. My fingers itched and my eyes shone while the cashier nipped at
      the comers of the bills with moistened fingers. He wrapped them in oiled
      paper and I sunk them carefully in my clothes!
    </p>
    <p>
      I made as quick a getaway as politeness would allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I remember it, I left a promise to come back to Breed City and settle
      down!
    </p>
    <p>
      I caught Judge Kingsley by the arm and hurried him down-street and into
      the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment we were in our room I began jamming packages of money into his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at it! Feel of it! Smell of it!&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;Judge, I took that money
      out for an airing and the junket did it lots of good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not understand. I guess he thought I&rsquo;d merely brought back the
      Pratt money and had gone crazy while I was out with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s sixteen thousand dollars net and clear for us, Judge Kingsley!
      And I reckon we won&rsquo;t hunt up Pratt and hand back the thousand that&rsquo;s over
      and above his graft from you. He&rsquo;s a liberal gentleman and he ought to be
      willing to pay our expenses and for wear and tear. Now pack up, sir!&rdquo; I
      clapped him on the shoulder. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop to tell you the story just yet.
      We&rsquo;ll have it on the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I began to pack the money into my pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was deathly white when he stood up, and he staggered against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the way! Where?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home!&rdquo; I yelled, frolicking like a lad. &ldquo;Home! And we&rsquo;ve got to make a
      race of it if we propose to head Uncle Deck Sidney under the wire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later I was humping around Breed City, trying to find out how
      I could escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stage would not leave till morning. And that stage would take us to
      Royal City, and blamed if I wanted to go through Royal City.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew well enough, of course, that Pratt had gone back there to join his
      forces and I could hardly hope that the forces were still in jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the new railroad which they were building into Breed only a part of the
      rails were down; they were not operating trains. There was no stage line
      through the broken country in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Buffalo Hump Mountains were to the south, and to the east the Bitter
      Root range raised obstructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the judge on my back, as it were! I couldn&rsquo;t wake him up to what had
      happened. He appeared to be mentally and physically prostrated. I myself
      could have straddled a cayuse and ducked out over the broken country. But
      the judge must have wheels under him when he was moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be nothing to do but smash through Royal City, taking our
      chances. I felt that the citizens there wouldn&rsquo;t see us murdered on the
      street, but they could not be expected to go along and guard us all the
      way home. We would have three buzzards on our trail!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was mighty blue and some scared. I was wishing that I had not indulged
      that boyish impulse to carry my fortune in cash. I would be fine picking
      for those devils! Take that money and the judge, and I had two pretty
      heavy parcels to tug back to the East. The dusk came down on Breed before
      I had braced myself to make the jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, there was nothing else to it!
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to catch trains and get to Levant ahead of calamity we must go
      back across Callas prairie and run the gantlet of those three renegades.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reckoned, according to my reading of time-tables, that the delay of even
      one day would bump our plans fatally.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had tried several times to find my friend, Mr. Wash Flye. I could not
      get on to his track to save me. I wanted to talk transportation with him,
      for I was having a mighty discouraging time of it with other parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were four public stables in the city, so I found by asking
      questions. I tackled the biggest one first. The man in the office was
      pulling off hip rubber boots with the air of one who has decided to call
      it a day. He laughed at me when I asked for a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, every cayuse in my stable that can walk, trot, run, or limp,
      or even can cover ground by rolling over is hired and has either started
      for the Blacksnake country where that new strike has been reported or else
      is going to start with a crazy prospector astraddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I offered to buy a horse. He said that he didn&rsquo;t do business that way&mdash;he
      had made promises and would keep them. I asked for names of men who had
      hired. I found a few and was turned down; they all expected to get rich if
      they could get to Blacksnake.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no better luck at the other stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bright Eyes&rdquo; had made me&mdash;it looked as if it would also unmake me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get it out of their heads in these parts that first-comers on a
      strike ain&rsquo;t due to be millionaires,&rdquo; one man told me. &ldquo;If you want a hoss
      you&rsquo;ll have to carpenter together a new one. The only plugs in the city
      that haven&rsquo;t been nailed by prospectors are the spare hosses of the stage
      company&mdash;and old Uncle Sam&rsquo;s mail keeps his thumb down hard on those
      critters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I set my teeth and began to hunt all the harder for my friend. I got
      word of him here and there, but an eel in a dock quicksand could not have
      been more of a dodger. It was evident that success had put springs into
      the legs and restlessness into the heart of this new Rockebilt of Breed
      City. The trail grew hot&mdash;the trail grew cold. It was late in the
      evening when I finally caught up with him. He was clinking glasses with
      &ldquo;Dirty-shirt&rdquo; Maddox, in a bar down an alley where Breed City&rsquo;s virtuous
      ten-o&rsquo;clock-closing ordinance could be more safely violated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done a lot for you, Mr. Mann, but I can&rsquo;t monkey-doodle with the
      company hosses at this time o&rsquo; year when the mud makes double work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drew him outdoors and down the alley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m meddling with another man&rsquo;s secret, my friend, but I&rsquo;m going to tell
      you enough so that you&rsquo;ll understand what this means to a poor old man
      and;&mdash;and&mdash;a girl back East.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the end of my little speech the driver put out his, wiry hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t do my part to help you in this job I&rsquo;d have-; to own up to
      having a spavined soul and a heart with, wind-puffs on it. Go out on the
      road a half-mile and I&rsquo;ll overtake you with two hosses and a mud-cart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before midnight our little expedition was well started across the prairie.
      The cart was light, the crisp air of the March night had stiffened the
      mud, and we naturally made-better time than with the heavy outfit on which
      we had ridden to Breed. But it was coming, dawn when we got to the
      rim-rock at the edge of Callas prairie.. Far below we could see the
      chimneys of Royal City, smoking signals of early breakfasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the crawl across the adobe ruts, under the stars, I had canvassed
      with the driver the dangers that the presence of Pratt and his associate
      rogues in Royal City held for two gentlemen who desired to mind their own
      business and travel East by that; first train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; stated the driver, after he had meditated on the matter, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      going to drop you right here at the rim-rock. Just over there is the mouth
      of a path that leads down the side of the canon by a short cut&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      all of two miles further by the stage-road where you came-up. The path
      doesn&rsquo;t hit the stage-road anywhere. Now if those chaps are out and free
      they&rsquo;ll be likely to ram across to Breed by this morning&rsquo;s stage. They
      want to see you mighty quick and what the mayor said to Pratt won&rsquo;t keep
      &rsquo;em away, I reckon! They must be reckless by now! If you walk down
      the path you&rsquo;ll dodge &rsquo;em&mdash;for the stage is just about
      leaving. There&rsquo;s an old feller named Mike at the foot of the path who&rsquo;ll
      ferry you. You&rsquo;ll have a full hour to make the train. Take your time down
      the path so that you&rsquo;ll be sure to miss the stage. If your men are still
      in Royal City&mdash;well, if I was in your place I&rsquo;d take that train,
      anyway, even if I had to leave orders behind for the funerals and the
      flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We climbed down and I started to shove my hand into my pocket. Mr. Flye
      threw his own hand to his hip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hands up!&rdquo; he called, sharply. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you pull that wallet! When a chap
      gets rich overnight like I&rsquo;ve done he&rsquo;s pretty touchy when a friend tries
      to put favor on a cash basis. I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d do it, Mr. Mann.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears came into my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hands up? Yes, hands up to you, good friend, both hands up to you.&rdquo; I
      grabbed the driver&rsquo;s fists in mine. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand just why you
      have done for me all that you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I smelled out by sort of instinct that you was giving up your
      time, doing good for somebody else,&rdquo; he said, with a nod at the old man.
      &ldquo;At any rate, I took to you, and when I take to a man it&rsquo;s all of a sudden
      and, doggone it, I just can&rsquo;t help giving him my shirt&mdash;if it&rsquo;s clean
      enough and he&rsquo;ll take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not trust himself to stay any longer. He lashed his horses, they
      spun around, dragging the cart on two wheels, and away the outfit went
      across the prairie. And I never saw Wash Flye any more!
    </p>
    <p>
      I hurried along and the old man found the path too steep for conversation.
      In places we were obliged to cling to sloping trees and ease our way down.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were startled, after a time, by the sudden appearance of a man in the
      path ahead. He was climbing with haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gents,&rdquo; he called, cheerily, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re lucky to be coming down
      instead of going up! But I figured that I&rsquo;d rather climb up to the prairie
      and get a little sunshine than stay down there and wait for that stage to
      get fixed up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and wiped his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the stage?&rdquo; I asked. I had a vision of Dragg, Dawlin, and
      Pratt waiting at the river below or lounging in the streets of Royal City,
      blocking our path of retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a tire came off, this side of the river, and the rim caved in.
      They&rsquo;ve propped up the old caboose and sent the wheel back to the
      blacksmith shop. You ought to have heard those other three passengers
      swear! I&rsquo;ve had a chance to hear it scientific and fancy in my time&mdash;but
      those gents certainly could hang on the trimmings. Especially the fat
      one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fat one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep! Fat man with a suit of clothes that would put the eyesight of a
      Potlatch coyote on the blink. They seem to be in a hurry. They&rsquo;re walking
      up this hill, too. Other two men are derricking fat man up the trail. Are
      making some talk about getting a rancher to set &rsquo;em across Callas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He clapped on his hat and climbed along.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had disappeared, I led the way into the pine growth at the side of
      the trail, and we found a boulder which would shield the two of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragg came first&mdash;carrying out the suggestion of his name by pulling
      at Mr. Pratt with all his strength, and Dawlin pushed behind. They halted
      often and one of their stops was just below our boulder. They were telling
      each other what they proposed to do to a certain person who wore a
      plug-hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew the two guns from my hip pockets, and I could feel the arm of the
      judge trembling against my ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after the three went puffing on and were out of sight, I dropped the
      weapons into a crevice between the ledges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I did not intend to shoot them,&rdquo; I said, when Judge Kingsley asked
      questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hurried on down the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you throw away those two good revolvers?&rdquo; asked the thrifty
      old chap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only borrowed them. It might seem like stealing if I should carry them
      back East. I don&rsquo;t like to have stolen property on my person,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not feel like talking. That remark stopped further conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We caught the train!

    <h2>
      XXIV&mdash;HOW SWEET IS THE HOME-COMING, EH?
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>Y thoughts, fears,
      and hopes went galloping ahead of me during that ride back to the East.
      It&rsquo;s all a blur of memory&mdash;wheat-fields, prune-orchards, tunnels,
      peaks, and prairies&mdash;and the old judge sitting beside me, twisting
      his withered hands and cracking his bony knuckles. It was lucky for both
      of us that the slow part of the journey was at the start and that we had
      the clang of mile-a-minute rails under us for the last two days of that
      race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I thought the thing over. It was just as much of a nightmare then as
      it seems now when I am setting it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      How I ever undertook such a crack-brained, daredevil trip and hoped for
      anything tangible to fall to me by such a hundred-to-one shot I do not
      understand even now in clear fashion, in spite of the explanation I have
      given. We talk about hunches in this world! If I had not obeyed some sort
      of suggestion I certainly would not have chased those renegades. Only by
      meeting with them did I stand a chance of recovering any money. That
      thought and my hankering to use my knowledge about the Pratt-Dawlin gang
      influenced me a great deal, I suppose. And the conviction that I couldn&rsquo;t
      spin a thread by seeking money in any other way pried me out of Levant, of
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have had something to say about the force of circumstances!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not in a comfortable frame of mind at all, though the money in my
      pockets should have given me considerable cheer. I did not feel that it
      was my money&mdash;any of it. I could not make it seem like anything which
      belonged to me or convince myself that I had earned it. I had picked a
      man&rsquo;s pocket for part of it and the rest of that cash had been jammed into
      my pockets, so to speak. I was not wasting a moment&rsquo;s time on questioning
      the morality of any of my acts. I reckoned if Pratt&rsquo;s wallet had been
      stuffed with twice as much I would have kept the plunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pondered on another point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Kingsley, provided we got under the wire in season, could be saved
      from the charge of criminality, but he still had his salvation,
      financially, to work out. He needed all that money and more&mdash;and I
      had volunteered&mdash;had forced myself on him as combination courier and
      savior. It was all settled in my mind, according to my private code, that
      I must hand over the cash.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will state right here that the decision I had come to about the money
      did not rasp my feelings in the slightest. I had read quite a few
      story-books in my time. If there was ever a case in the whole realm of
      fact and fiction where the final scene would show loving daughter clasped
      in adoring lover&rsquo;s arms, and a benignant father raising his hands over
      them with &ldquo;Bless-you-my-children&rdquo; sentiment, my affair seemed to be
      triumphantly of that sort. Time, effort, and money&mdash;it all belonged
      in the family!
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart glowed and my eyes grew moist and it was a wonder that I did not
      blurt out the whole thing to the judge&mdash;I felt so sure of him!
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he had his own troubles to take up his mind pretty completely, I
      realized. There was no telling what might be happening back home, with my
      uncle Deck stirring things. If I had timed trains right, and nothing
      tipped upside down, we didn&rsquo;t have much more than twenty-four hours&rsquo;
      leeway in Levant ahead of that town meeting. I asked the judge if the town
      notes were very widely scattered, and he told me they were not. He had
      picked special parties whom he could depend on to keep their mouths shut
      about their investment, and he felt pretty sure that they would hand back
      the notes in exchange for cash and would ask no questions and would keep
      still in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t eat and I can&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; he mourned, &ldquo;not till I have those
      papers in my two hands!&rdquo; He put up his crooked claws and worked them. &ldquo;In
      my hands&mdash;all torn into ribbons&mdash;and then into the fire! Just
      think of it!&rdquo; He croaked the words and shivered. &ldquo;Papers&mdash;only a few
      papers! Scattered around town. Papers with ink-marks! Yet they can send me
      to State prison!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, that wasn&rsquo;t the time to talk with the judge about being his partner or
      his son-in-law. But I did talk more with him in regard to plans for
      gathering in the notes quietly and quickly the moment we struck town. I
      had him give me the names so that I could help plan the campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew them, of course. They were old tight-wads of farmers in the back
      districts who would endure lighted candles at their feet for a long time
      before they would leak any information about their money matters; there
      were some widows and old maids who didn&rsquo;t know anything about money
      matters, anyway. The judge had picked well, I had to admit to myself. But
      there was a lot to do, a mighty short time to do it in, and it had got to
      be done with the delicate touch a bashful chap would use in picking a
      rose-leaf off a sleeping schoolmarm&rsquo;s cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, this was my suggestion to the judge: we&rsquo;d slip off the train a
      station below Levant Comers, hire a hitch, and make our rounds of the
      town&rsquo;s creditors in the back-lots before we showed up in Levant village.
    </p>
    <p>
      That&rsquo;s what we did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lengthened days of April gave us a full hour and a half of sunlight
      for our ride on our quest. Out of cupboards and long wallets and rosewood
      boxes the farmers and the old maids dutifully produced their town notes&mdash;&ldquo;for
      the judge had called on.&rdquo; They seemed to believe that his wish to call in
      the notes settled the matter beyond all question.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became once more his dignified, calm, self-contained self, though I
      could see that it was only by exercise of all his will power.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had placed packets of money in his hands and he figured interest and
      made payments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first man with whom he did business gave the judge his cue and made me
      thank the good Lord that I had planted that seed in Dodovah Vose!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking better than I have ever seen you, Judge! Younger, too!
      What have you been doing to yourself? Oh, your whiskers are cut off!
      Improves you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment we had struck Spokane I bought alcohol and stripped that
      grotesque mustache from the judge&rsquo;s face. In spite of his haggard
      countenance, he did look younger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s said around town,&rdquo; proceeded Farmer Bailey&mdash;=and I held my
      breath and did not dare to look at Judge Kingsley&mdash;&ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve just
      cleaned up a lot of money in a big deal. Dod Vose has given out first
      news! We&rsquo;re all glad of it because we have always looked up to you as a
      financier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge nodded stiffly in acknowledgment of the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose he has made you rich, too, young Sidney, taking you under
      his wing like he has,&rdquo; suggested the farmer, with a wink. &ldquo;Your uncle is
      giving you a black eye for deserting the family&mdash;like he done the
      first time you left town&mdash;but I guess you haven&rsquo;t made any mistake by
      grabbing in with Judge Kingsley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite sure of that,&rdquo; I told Farmer Bailey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate to take this money, Judge,&rdquo; said the farmer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been safe with
      you. I ain&rsquo;t a financier like you be. It hasn&rsquo;t been taxed. You bet I have
      kept my mouth shut!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only to clear up town business on account of the special meeting
      which has been called for to-morrow,&rdquo; stated the judge. &ldquo;I am glad to hear
      you have kept the matter private. I merely tried to help a few of my
      friends. And I suggest that you say nothing about having received this
      money or that you have surrendered a town note. There are disturbers in
      town who threaten a high tax-rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Deck Sidney, thrashing around to make a big show of his authority,
      now that he is selectman,&rdquo; the farmer grumbled. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t being backed up
      by the people, I can tell you that! It&rsquo;s all right to be enterprising, but
      he is too cussed much so. He was around here the other day, trying to nose
      out whether I held a town note or not!&rdquo; I felt a thrill of fear and the
      judge grew visibly paler. &ldquo;Yes, he hung on and coaxed and threatened and
      argued. But I knew what he was up to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He winked at the shrinking judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said if I didn&rsquo;t bring my town note into the meeting I&rsquo;d never be able
      to collect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he know you held a town note?&rdquo; croaked the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know! He was round town guessing. I never let on. I knew he
      wasn&rsquo;t any financier. I knew that you&rsquo;d protect me, no matter what Deck
      Sidney might say. I smelled him out, all right! He thinks he is running
      this town and he tried to bamboozle me so that he could find some more
      property to tax. I reckon we&rsquo;ll show him where he belongs when it comes to
      next annual meeting. He&rsquo;s getting altogether too big for his britches!&rdquo; We
      learned much more about my uncle&rsquo;s recent activities before we finished
      our ride. Evidently, when he had held his nose in the air he had sniffed
      town notes; but when he had set his nose to the ground and had tried to
      run those notes to their lairs he had failed. At any rate, the holders
      protested to the judge that they had not dropped one word&mdash;all of
      them suspecting that my uncle was merely digging out property to tax. The
      resentful farmers had replied to his anathema with some of their own and
      the frightened old maids had been too scared to say anything to him. We
      heard enough to know that he had traveled more or less by guesswork, and
      had made his quest general, hoping to corner somebody by chance. If we
      could believe the protestations of the parties concerned, Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s
      defenses still presented a fair front to the world..
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, before the evening was old, the judge had taken into his hands
      the last note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we ordered our driver to hurry us to the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sidney,&rdquo; said the judge, when he had paid the driver and stood in the
      shadows at the edge of the square, &ldquo;this is not the time to talk over our
      affairs, but I do want you to step into my office for a few moments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big house was dark and a queer kind of a shiver ran through me when I
      looked at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil must have had me in his clutch all these days,&rdquo; muttered the
      judge. &ldquo;I have been worse than a lunatic. Not a word from me to my poor
      folks at home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To tell the truth, I had not been giving much thought to our remissness in
      that duty. I have never been much of a letter-writer in my life&mdash;I
      had been so long without folks who cared to hear from me that the matter
      of keeping anybody posted on my whereabouts never came into my mind. To be
      sure, I had Celene Kingsley in my mind all the time, even in the stress of
      our adventures, but I had not presumed to write to her. During our travels
      it had not occurred to me that it was any part of my business to prompt
      Judge Kingsley in any of his family affairs. But now that we were back, in
      front of that gloomy house, I realized just how brutal the whole thing
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge went to his office door and his hand trembled so violently that
      the key clattered all around the hole; what with the darkness and his
      agitation, he could not unlock the door, and I did it for him, gently
      taking the key from his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lighted his lamp when we were within. We stood there for a few moments
      and looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so still!&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;It seems early for them to be in bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your folks must be all right,&rdquo; I ventured. &ldquo;If there was anything
      wrong we would have heard about it while we have been riding about town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably! Probably!&rdquo; His voice quavered and he was all a-tremble. &ldquo;But it
      seems so still!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down at his table and pulled out the notes he had been gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are entitled to look on, Mr. Sidney! I wanted you to see me do it. I
      don&rsquo;t just understand all the reasons yet why you have helped me as you
      have. We will talk about that some day when my head is clearer. It&rsquo;s all a
      dream&mdash;a dream&mdash;a dream&mdash;so it seems now.&rdquo; He sort of
      maundered along in his talk. He did not seem to be at all sure of himself.
      If the thought did come to me with any force that then was a good time to
      tell him why I had volunteered as I had done, I put the idea away when I
      looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dumped papers out of a tin tray which stood on the table. He piled the
      notes in the tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Touch a match to them, sir,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;You are entitled to do it. We
      will watch them burn. I signed them as town treasurer. One of them would
      put me into prison. Hurry! Set the match to them!&rdquo; And I obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, almost before the red embers were dark, he dove his hands into the
      ashes of the papers and scrufled them about and out of him came the most
      dreadful cackle of laughter I ever heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was anxious to end that scene as quickly as I could. I pulled a packet
      from my coat and laid it on the table; I tapped my finger on it to get his
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is something I have held out, Judge Kingsley,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I informed him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a thousand dollars tied up in this paper. Five
      hundred of it I accepted from Dodo-vah Vose, agreeing to put him in right
      in our speculation. I took it when I started West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his emotion the old judge&rsquo;s business sense flared just as the
      fire had flared in the tray a moment before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there was no speculation&mdash;there was no business deal! Why did
      you take money in that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had special reasons of my own, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you had no right&mdash;it was a private affair&mdash;it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I also had reasons of your own to consider, sir,&rdquo; I broke in. &ldquo;Mr.
      Vose asked me to invest for him. I wanted your name to stand well after we
      were gone. I was under obligations to Mr. Vose and when I told him we had
      a big deal on I could give him no good reason why I would not turn a
      little profit his way. That&rsquo;s why the man Bailey is so sure that your
      credit is now good. You&rsquo;ll find that the news has gone all about the
      section&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be jumping on me for the money I owe!&rdquo; snarled the judge. &ldquo;Vose
      has ruined me if he has bragged. You have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment, sir, before you say something you&rsquo;ll be sorry for. It&rsquo;s
      just the other way, I&rsquo;ll warrant! Men will bring more money to you. You
      can be shrewd and work out of your troubles. Your credit is established. I
      made a good play when I did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say there&rsquo;s a thousand dollars in that envelope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir! I have handed the other packets to you. I propose to give Mr.
      Vose five hundred dollars profit&mdash;and after I have done that you&rsquo;ll
      get the best advertising you ever had. They&rsquo;ll rate you mighty high in
      these parts. Five hundred is a cheap price for what you&rsquo;ll get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I need every cent just now to tide me over,&rdquo; he whined. &ldquo;You are
      throwing money away recklessly. Vose can be taken care of some time. Give
      him his own five hundred&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;say it has been invested
      for him. I will attend to his case later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And do you know what that old rhinoceros did? He reached out his paw to
      take that packet. I had to pound my fist on his fingers to make him let
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up and called me names&mdash;said that I was taking money he
      needed. I suppose I ought to have made allowances for the state of mind he
      was in&mdash;his fears&mdash;his weakness of old age&mdash;his dreadful
      anxiety which still goaded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was in a bad way, myself, and I could not pardon that selfishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound you,&rdquo; I yelled, &ldquo;I have a mind to back you against the wall and
      strip every dollar out of your pockets!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then we heard a noise and we turned around, and there stood Celene
      Kingsley looking at us&mdash;looking at me especially with hatred and
      horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Shall I run and call help? He is robbing you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I certainly could not say a word just then, and the judge sat down and
      gasped and gaped at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came into the room. She was white and pale and thin, but she was no
      shrinking and anguished maiden. She was showing the female&rsquo;s ferocity in
      guarding her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you! Confessing that you&rsquo;re a robber out of your own mouth! Where
      have you been with my poor father? What devilish spell have you put on him&mdash;you
      and the rest of your gang?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, don&rsquo;t you realize that you have come home when it is too late?
      Oh, God in heaven, why did you not break away from those rogues and come
      home&mdash;or write so that we could ransom you? I know. They have kept
      you a prisoner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late?&rdquo; he looked at his office safe. I knew what he was afraid of.
      &ldquo;Too late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to sob. &ldquo;It has killed mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and staggered to her and took her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than that! It&rsquo;s her mind&mdash;it has gone, and her body is
      following. She hasn&rsquo;t known me for days. She lies there dying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was shocked, but I must confess I did not feel like a murderer. Mrs.
      Kingsley had been ill when we went away&mdash;she had so declared in my
      hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Kingsley,&rdquo; I put in, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but your father and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tears ceased and she turned on me in a fury. I knew something about
      the Kingsley disposition, but I did not know before that she had so much
      of it in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry! You sorry? I know about you, you miserable low-lived wretch! I
      have been hunting for my father. Do you think I would look down on my
      dying mother and not spend every cent I had in trying to find where you
      had taken him? My detectives have been on that trail you left in the
      city!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Able detectives! On the cold and easy trail instead of nosing on the warm
      one!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But please listen to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To more of your lies? No! I know you for what you are&mdash;hiding from
      the police in the city&mdash;coming back here to finish the ruin of my
      innocent father after your friends had been, sent here by you to rob him.
      You don&rsquo;t dare to deny what you have been in the city! Your face convicts
      you!&rdquo; >
    </p>
    <p>
      I was perfectly conscious that I was not presenting any lamb-like picture
      of innocence. She certainly had me on the run when she burst out with that
      exposure of my city record. But I did not propose to lie down and stick up
      my feet like a calf ticketed for the butcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Kingsley,&rdquo; I said, slapping the packet of money across my palm&mdash;and
      that was a poor tool to use for emphasis after she had heard my talk to
      her father, &ldquo;you must listen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been listening just now! I heard you threaten to strip my poor
      father of every cent he has in the world! Do you deny you said it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you deny that you have been the sort of a man I have said you were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rushed at me, her hands like claws. I was reminded of a sight I had
      witnessed in boyhood&mdash;a shrieking meadow-thrush defending her nest
      against a sneaking snake.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked past her toward the judge. I did hope he would say something,
      even though I did not expect that he would come out with the whole truth.
      Honestly, I would have stopped him short if he had started to confess to
      her anything about the real reason why I was mixed into his affairs. Had
      not the whole expedition been planned so that the women folks would not
      know?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, a decent man in his right senses could have made some sort
      of talk to help me out. But it was plain enough that Judge Kingsley was
      not in his right senses&mdash;he did not seem to have much of any sense
      left in him; he was doddering around the room, twisting his hands and
      accusing himself of having killed his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please listen,&rdquo; I implored. &ldquo;You have heard only one side&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not listen! You, your uncle, the renegades you associate with, you
      have tried to ruin my father. You weren&rsquo;t even decent enough to be an open
      enemy&mdash;you came sneaking into our home to lie to us and deceive us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the gods,&rdquo; I shouted, &ldquo;you will listen to me! I don&rsquo;t propose to be
      kicked around from pillar to post all my life. I am the best friend the
      Kingsley family ever had. If your father doesn&rsquo;t tell you so, I will.
      Judge Kingsley, why don&rsquo;t you be a man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he gave me a fishy look and went on lamenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started for the door. &ldquo;There are honest men in this village&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      going to call them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I got to the door ahead of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another time coming&mdash;a better time for an explanation&mdash;and
      you&rsquo;ll be the sorriest girl in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can never be as sorry as I am now&mdash;sorry and ashamed! To think
      that I ever put confidence in a creature by the name of Sidney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a glorious home-coming for the paragon of selfsacrifice!
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked around the square half a dozen times before I dared to go into
      the tavern. I don&rsquo;t know how I ever got through that interview with
      Dodovah Vose without betraying my state of mind, but I managed it and
      excused my peculiarity by saying that I was all worn out by my trip. And
      he had too much on his own mind in a few minutes to pay special attention
      to me, for I handed him one thousand dollars and went up to my room
      without bothering to contradict his excited guessings that the judge and I
      had cleaned up a fortune. Kingsley, I reflected, might as well have the
      benefit of the guessing. And, it must be known, hope was not dead in me in
      spite of my agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something else was very much alive in me. Blackleg, eh? Flashy rogue!
      Barker for gamblers!
    </p>
    <p>
      I took off that plug-hat, held it in both hands, and put my foot through
      the crown; then I kicked it all around the room. I stripped off that
      frock-coat, grabbed the tails and ripped it into two parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I went to the closet and surveyed that ready-made suit and the
      billycock hat with content.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning I would be Ross Sidney, professional diver, ready to go
      back on the job if there was any such thing as a job for me in all the
      world. I hoped I would be sane once more when I opened my eyes on a new
      day. I yanked that fancy waistcoat into ribbons, threw the pearl-gray
      trousers under the bed, and hurried to go to sleep so that I would not
      become completely crazy before I could forget my troubles.

      XXV&mdash;GRATITUDE!
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE surely is a
      lot in this conscious-virtue notion! I had plenty of the quality next
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things seemed brighter. I felt like myself once more. It was inconceivable
      that the horrible misunderstanding between Celene Kingsley and myself
      could continue very long; I was ready to make confession as to my
      temporary lunacy in the city, and my new optimism encouraged me to believe
      that she would find excuse for me. At any rate, I was soon assured that
      whatever she had learned from that detective, whoever he was, she had kept
      it to herself. From that reticence I drew excellent augury that she was
      not out to ruin me. If she had opened her mouth about my past I would have
      known it the moment I stepped out on the street in Levant. But every
      person I met ducked polite salute, and I met many persons because the
      village was full on account; of the town meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock the town hall was crowded and in a short time the
      cut-and-dried preliminaries were over.
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle was with his associates on the platform, and the stare he gave me
      when he caught my eyes was so demoniac that I was careful not to look his
      way again for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was evidence of strained anticipation everywhere in the gathering. I
      heard voters whispering that Deck Sidney proposed to spring something. But
      nobody, according to what I could hear, presumed to put in words what they
      guessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle was mashing his personal batteries, I saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unemotional lawyer explained the purpose of the meeting, and then the
      moderator called on Judge Kingsley, as town treasurer, to give the
      financial standing of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Deck fairly bored the judge with his gaze when the old man walked to
      the platform and I was as intent with my scrutiny, for I was wondering how
      Kingsley would get through with it. He was white and somewhat shaky, but
      he was the same old cold proposition when he faced the voters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will pardon a word on a personal matter,&rdquo; he said, as he
      unfolded his papers; &ldquo;but I have returned from a business trip and find
      serious illness in my family. I have been keeping watch at the bedside of
      my dear wife and my thoughts are not clear enough to enable me to make the
      little address I had contemplated for to-day. I will only say that the
      movement to clear the town of its debt is very praiseworthy and my report
      will show that the thing may be done with a little extra effort. Our only
      considerable indebtedness consists of town bonds amounting to eight
      thousand dollars and current items as follows.&rdquo; Then he went on to give
      the list of unpaid town orders, of which only a few were extant. &ldquo;I see
      here representatives of the bondholders,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;who will check my
      figures if such assurance is required by any voter&mdash;and probably most
      of the parties who hold town orders are in the meeting. I hope the town
      orders will be presented for payment at once so that there may be no
      floating indebtedness.&rdquo; He folded up his papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle got up and stamped down his trousers legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you voters,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;ask your questions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But not a voice was raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no lawyer and I&rsquo;m making no threats,&rdquo; my uncle went on. &ldquo;But after
      the way this meeting has been advertised, and after the call that has been
      made, I reckon that the men who have been holding out claims against this
      town and who haven&rsquo;t presented them will be left to whistle for their
      money. I propose to have action taken that will outlaw those claims.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Kingsley turned slowly on my uncle and stood as stiff as a stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what claims do you refer, Selectman Sidney? Do you question the
      accuracy of my report?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out of your holes, you old woodchucks!&rdquo; shouted Uncle Deck, looking
      past the judge at the voters. Men scowled at him and grumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge walked toward the First Selectman and shook his papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must talk to me, sir! I am the treasurer of this town and have been
      for a good many years. Here before the voters I demand that you specify
      claims.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll specify, then! How about the town notes that are out with your name
      on them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A murmur ran through the assemblage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just one moment, sir! Weigh your words,&rdquo; warned the judge. &ldquo;You are
      attacking my financial reputation; there is a law for slanderers and I
      have many witnesses here. Do you say there is one single town note extant
      with my name on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say there are a lot of &rsquo;em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time many voters raised voices of protest and there were hisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thanks a straight man gets for trying to protect his town
      against a thief, eh?&rdquo; raged my uncle, his ready temper bursting loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the judge don&rsquo;t collect fifty thousand dollars damages for this, then
      I&rsquo;m no guesser,&rdquo; declared Dodovah Vose, who sat beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Deck tramped to the edge of the platform and with wagging finger
      selected a man in the throng; the man was Farmer Bailey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bailey, you hold a town note with Kingsley&rsquo;s name on it! You know you do!
      Are you going to sit there and see it canceled as no good by the vote of
      this town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bailey rose slowly and everybody listened in deep silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hold no note of any kind with Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s name on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yah-h-h! You have told me that before. But you don&rsquo;t dare to stand here
      in town meeting and say it under oath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send down that Bible on the stand and I&rsquo;ll take oath and kiss the Book,&rdquo;
       offered Bailey. There was applause and the judge quieted it by raising his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will pay double for any note with my name on it as treasurer, and I
      will turn the money over to the town as a gift,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I despised him when he made that bluff, though of course he had to do it.
      Really, in spite of his devilish temper and his spirit of revenge my uncle
      was twice the man Judge Kingsley was in that moment. I wasn&rsquo;t trying to
      figure out the righteousness of the thing on either side; the judge was
      fighting for his very life, as well as his standing, and my uncle, though
      he was working for the good of the town according to his lights, was
      satisfying his old grudge&mdash;the real passion of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voter rose and bellowed until he secured silence; they were giving the
      judge an ovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to put in a word here, fellow-townsmen! Money has been borrowed on
      town notes. A certain eminent man you all know tried to borrow from me and
      said I could escape taxation. And now he is backed by the liars&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And barked at by the liars, too,&rdquo; yelled another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stand up here for Selectman Sidney, who has given his time and effort
      to help this town out of the clutches&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They howled him down. But by this time the defenders of my uncle were
      howling, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This meeting is going to break up in a free fight if a stop isn&rsquo;t put to
      this jawing,&rdquo; said Dodovah Vose. He jumped up on the settee and made
      himself heard. &ldquo;I move we adjourn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The apprehensive moderator put the motion, the judge&rsquo;s friends carried it,
      and the meeting was dissolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle leaped off the platform and came raging at me through the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you&mdash;you damnation imp of Gehenna! Racing and chasing over this
      town yesterday! I had a line on you. Saving that old whelp from what was
      coming to him!&rdquo; He put his hands over his head and wriggled his fingers.
      &ldquo;God! I don&rsquo;t know what you have done&mdash;you got that money by robbing
      a bank, probably. But you have done it&mdash;you have jumped up and down
      on your family! You have got to answer to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Men pushed away in panic and left us in a ring. But I had no notion of
      entertaining the old goggle-eyes of Levant by fisticuffs with my uncle. I
      folded my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to your reckoning, Uncle Deck, I have owed you something for a
      long time. I want to stand square with you! Go ahead and collect!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not seem to understand at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead and beat me up! I won&rsquo;t raise a finger.&rdquo; Yes, I would have taken
      the beating&mdash;I knew inside of me that I did owe my uncle something of
      the sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by a dam-site, he sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t beat you up,&rdquo; declared Dodovah Vose. &ldquo;I
      saved you from him once,&rdquo; he said, careless of revelations, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll save
      you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, after waiting a minute and enduring my uncle&rsquo;s tongue instead of his
      fists, I went away with Landlord Vose.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not in the mood for any further paltering or palavering in regard to
      my personal and private standing with the Kingsley family. I had a
      collection to make and I proposed to go and make it. I ought to have known
      better than to force the issue at that time. But youth is headstrong, the
      sense of my injuries was hot, and I felt that if ever the judge might be
      willing to show his gratitude that would be the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was crossing the square on his way home and I left Mr. Vose and hurried
      after. I caught up with him at the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to come in and have a word with you and with your daughter,&rdquo; I
      told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; he said, curtly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid my wife is at death&rsquo;s door. And
      my daughter&mdash;she is very bitter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I propose to have you explain enough so that she will not be bitter, sir.
      It&rsquo;s my due. You know what kind of a service I have rendered. I have made
      an enemy of my uncle&mdash;ruined all my prospects to help you. There are
      things you can tell your daughter to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does my daughter enter into any affairs between you and myself? You
      must let me alone in my sorrow. Later I will pay you for your services. I
      am grateful. If I were not in such distress I would explain how grateful I
      am. I will pray that I may be spared till I can pay back to you what I
      owe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Cæsar! I don&rsquo;t want your money, Judge Kingsley. I&rsquo;ll work and earn
      more to help you out of your difficulties. I only ask you to be a man and
      make your daughter understand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter again! You don&rsquo;t presume&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do presume, sir. She was kind to me until this horrible
      misunderstanding came up. I expect you to tell her that I am your best
      friend. It&rsquo;s my right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;ll never forget the look he gave me. I&rsquo;ll wager a good bit that the idea
      of such enormity on my part never came into his Kingsley consciousness
      till that moment. Even then he did not seem to be just sure that he
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect anything definite from you or her, Judge Kingsley, until I
      have made good in the world. But I do look to you to give me a square
      deal. That&rsquo;s only what you owe to me, man to man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owe you money and I will pay it. There is no other sort of bargain
      between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped into his house and shut the door in my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that damnable situation I was minded to follow him and have it out,
      even if I were obliged to expose him. However, if death were hovering over
      that house it was a sanctuary I could not invade. But bitter thoughts
      raged in me when I turned away; I only asked to be set right with Celene.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand that this part of my confession will elicit little sympathy
      for me from the casual reader who takes the comfortable view that the
      world is full of girls and if one does not swing low enough on the bough
      there&rsquo;s always another within reach. But mine was the exceptional case
      where the first love had become an obsession and all my spirit of
      persistency was flaming in me. I have not figured out as yet whether the
      troubles into which my general persistency in all matters has slammed me
      overbalance the fruits it has brought to me&mdash;but I reckon, after all,
      I&rsquo;ll have to take my hat off to my persistency. If I had been a quitter I
      would not have played the biggest game in my life&mdash;and I&rsquo;m coming to
      that right soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more circumstances were forcing me, though I needed mighty little
      forcing, to leave Levant at that juncture in my affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn &rsquo;em!&rdquo; I blazed out to Dodovah Vose when I stamped into the
      tavern, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to show &rsquo;em! I&rsquo;ll show &rsquo;em I can make
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He blinked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have shown &rsquo;em already,&rdquo; he said. He thought, of course,
      that I was speaking about the general public in Levant. &ldquo;And if I was in
      your place I wouldn&rsquo;t give a dam what your uncle says to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Less than two hours later Landlord Vose revised that advice. He rushed up
      to my room where I was sorting some papers, having resolved to travel
      light when I did go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get under&mdash;get under, young Sidney,&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I mean get out. It&rsquo;s your uncle Deck! Bailey and some other of
      them yawp-mouths in this place have been twitting and tormenting him and
      dropping hints, and he&rsquo;s worse than a sore-eared bulldog after a
      scruffing. He&rsquo;s coming with a double-barreled shot-gun. He is! He&rsquo;s drunk,
      son, and there&rsquo;s no dealing with him. He lays it all to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he isn&rsquo;t responsible, son. To say nothing of what will happen to you,
      it means that he&rsquo;ll go to State prison. You&rsquo;re sane and sober and you
      ought to be willing to save him from himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Right then Mr. Vose said something which appealed to me. I had stepped
      outside my family&mdash;I had conspired against my uncle&mdash;I had
      blocked his dearest ambition, iniquitous though it was. By hanging around
      and allowing him to take pot-shots at me I would be aggravating his
      troubles and bringing more serious afflictions upon him. A dead nephew,
      shot-riddled, would be a damning exhibit A in his trial for murder!
    </p>
    <p>
      I picked up my few belongings and escaped from the back door of the
      tavern, hid in a cross-road till Dodovah Vose&rsquo;s stableman came with a
      hitch, and I caught a train at a station down the line; hustling out of my
      native town on the run, by dint of practice, was getting to be one of the
      best performances in my list of tricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I counted my money when I was on my way to the city. I had not been
      keeping any strict account between the judge and myself; from the common
      stock I had been paying expenses and spending as loose as peas in order to
      hasten our journey back East. I found around two hundred and fifty dollars
      in my pockets, and I reflected, with a sort of grim zest in the humor of
      the thing, that I could fairly claim most of this money as my own&mdash;the
      tainted cash from my poker profits.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went straight to Jodrey Vose when I arrived in the metropolis and he
      looked neither surprised nor overjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sort of loafing around up-country&mdash;killing time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He squinted at me sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that you&rsquo;re doing any great credit to my training, young
      Sidney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Captain Vose, but I&rsquo;m turning over a new leaf and I&rsquo;m out
      to make good. I am hoping that I can do something in the case of Anson C.
      Doughty so that I can get back into the diving business and keep on the
      job hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll go back to diving and keep out from under plug-hats, will
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me for a long time and then he pulled out a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This here,&rdquo; he said, tapping it, &ldquo;is something more about that <i>Golden
      Gate</i> treasure. There&rsquo;s a new crowd on the rampage about it. From
      somebody in the old crowd they have got hold of my name. I came nigh
      trying it on once, as I have told you. But it&rsquo;s a gamble; I am old and I
      don&rsquo;t want it. You are young and there&rsquo;s nothing as yet for you on the
      Atlantic coast, and you might grab in on this. They want an Eastern diver
      because the divers out there are tied up with the big concerns and can&rsquo;t
      be depended on to keep their mouths shut&mdash;so this letter says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably it&rsquo;s a pretty uncertain proposition, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t expect to fall into anything very certain, do you, a
      diver blacklisted from Kittery to the Keys?&rdquo; he demanded, tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about these people, their plans, or anything. But I&rsquo;ll do
      this for you, if you want me to. I&rsquo;ll wire this party and tell him I am
      sending you on. After you are started you can post him from some place as
      to when you&rsquo;ll arrive. Better give him a wire from time to time to keep
      his interest up. How&rsquo;s your wallet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s all right, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re lying to me that&rsquo;s your own lookout. Haven&rsquo;t sold your
      diving-dress, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it safe in storage, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad you kept remembering that you&rsquo;re a diver&mdash;and the
      best one I ever turned out!&rdquo; That was the first word of high praise he had
      given me. He got up and shook my hand. &ldquo;Now go dive, son, and after you
      raise that four million from the wreck of the Golden Gate come back and
      tell me all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not linger in the city; there were too many possibilities in the way
      of Dawlins and Doughtys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later I was headed across the continent with my diving-dress in
      its canvas bag and the address of one Captain Rask Holstrom written in my
      note-book. I was pretty dizzy with the haste of it all and felt like the
      human shuttle between oceans&mdash;but I possessed considerable more
      serenity than I did when I began that lunatic lope with Judge Kingsley.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had framed a motto and hung it in my soul&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show &rsquo;em!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XXVI&mdash;CAPTAIN HOLSTROM ET AL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>Y face was set to
      the West, to be sure, but my thoughts were traveling back over my shoulder
      to the East. I wish I could say that a lively sense of injury enabled me
      to put out of my mind Levant and everybody in Levant&mdash;box and dice!
      But I&rsquo;m not much of a liar.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not propose to dwell on the bitterness which stuck in me day after
      day, along with softer sentiments. This narrative goes into a gallop at
      about this point and there is no time to be wasted on self-communings.
      However, if I do not mention my old home and the folks back there it must
      not be understood that the problem of my life ceased to go to bed with me,
      rise with me, and keep pace with me as I hurried through the day&rsquo;s work. I
      obeyed Jodrey Vose&rsquo;s counsel about giving bulletins of my progress west.
      After I had bought my railroad ticket and had counted up, I felt that I
      could not afford to take any chances on those strangers losing their
      interest in me. I needed a job almighty sudden after I landed in San
      Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last leg of the journey I was able to forecast the hour of my
      arrival and I suggested by wire that somebody meet me&mdash;knowing that
      my diver&rsquo;s kit in its duck bag would be identification enough. This
      telegraph business was shooting arrows into the air and I would have
      welcomed a return message; I thought they ought to be able to guess
      closely enough to intercept me somewhere along the line. But, although no
      answer came, I had the comfortable feeling that they&rsquo;d be likely to be on
      the lookout for me. And at last I got my first peek at Pacific waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our train was hung up outside the yard over in Oakland while they opened
      our track to the ferry, and a chap I had chatted with more or less in the
      smoking-room on the trip, and who knew my business, rushed out, climbed
      down beside the roadbed, and scooped a tumblerful of water. He ran back
      into the car and dumped the water over me for a joke, and I&rsquo;m so
      accustomed to water that the joke did not jar me. I took it as it was
      meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I baptize thee in the name of the Pacific,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now I hope the old
      dame will be good to you in your line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, whether she was or not depends on how one looks at those things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked slowly through the ferry-house, hoping to be hailed, and stepped
      out on to the foot of Market Street into the old San Francisco of the days
      before the great calamity. In my right hand I tugged along the duck bag
      that was bulging with my diving equipment. In my left hand I had the rest
      of my earthly possessions in a grip which was about the size of a ten-cent
      loaf of bread. It was early evening, and all the lights were aglare.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a turn-table for the cable cars at the foot of Market Street.
      The cars were coming down in constant procession, and the turn-table was
      busy. It was a regular merry-go-round kind of an affair. It interested me,
      but it didn&rsquo;t interest me so much that I had no eye for a girl who stood
      beside me at the edge of the thing. It seemed to me right then&mdash;fresh
      from a tedious train ride, where I&rsquo;d been penned in with a frumpy set of
      women passengers&mdash;that I had never seen a prettier girl. She had her
      finger pointed at some one on the turn-table, and was saying &ldquo;Father!&rdquo;
       over and over, with a new inflection on the word every time she spoke it.
      Her finger traveled as the table revolved, and I was able to pick out
      father fight away. I was right-down sorry for that girl when I laid eyes
      on father. Father was grinning like a sculpin in deep water, and he was
      good and drunk, and he was evidently taking a joy ride on that turn-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck me right then, as a stranger, that San Francisco had a good
      trait pretty well developed; it was willing to let a man mind his own
      business as long as he didn&rsquo;t make too much of a nuisance of himself. The
      street-car men did not push father off the turn-table, and two policemen
      took a look at him and went off about their business.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a good look at the man, too, when the turntable brought him near me
      and stopped to let a car on. He had a face about as square as the front of
      a safe, and his nose was the shape of a safety-lock knob, and was red. His
      pot-bellied body was set on legs like crooked wharf pilings. I had father
      sized up in a second. Double-breasted blue coat, cap of blue, with the
      peak pulled rakishly down over one eye, gray beard which radiated in
      spills from his chin like tiller spokes&mdash;he was a steamboat man,
      sure! I don&rsquo;t know what in the devil possessed me to butt in and make
      certain&mdash;perhaps I wanted to start something so as to get a rise out
      of the girl. I&rsquo;m not naturally fresh and you may be sure I was in no mood
      for a flirtation. I was crusted with Yankee reserve even when I was young.
      But that impish air of San Francisco was in my nostrils&mdash;did you ever
      sniff it? It makes your head buzz and your thoughts froth, and it takes
      hold of an Easterner as quickly as a stiff cocktail grabs a man who isn&rsquo;t
      used to a mixed drink. You&rsquo;ll do almost anything in San Francisco when the
      sparkle from that trade-wind gets into your lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I tipped father the wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give her the jingle when she starts again,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was right in my guess. He crooked his forefinger, reached down, and
      yanked empty air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clang!&rdquo; he barked. In a few seconds the turntable began to revolve again.
      Father gave me as silly a grin as I ever saw on a grown-up man&rsquo;s face.
      &ldquo;Yingleyingle&mdash;yingle!&rdquo; he yelled in falsetto. And away he went!
    </p>
    <p>
      I never got a more awful look from a pretty girl than I got from that one
      when I turned and caught her eyes. There was nothing shrinking or bashful
      about her when she was mad, so I found out then and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fool! You have started him all over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed to be well started before I came along, miss.&rdquo; It was that
      confounded air that was making me reckless and saucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clang!&rdquo; yelped father, coming around again. &ldquo;Yingle&mdash;yingle&mdash;yingle!
      Pull in them port fenders and mouse that anchor; we&rsquo;re going outside this
      trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just see the fool notion you have gone and put into him when he was all
      ready to come along with me!&rdquo; she blazed. She knocked her little knuckles
      together in as fine a state of temper as I ever viewed spouting in a
      female. She turned suddenly and drove one of her fists against a man whom
      I had not noticed till then. He was tall&mdash;as long as the moral law,
      as we say East&mdash;as thin as a pump-handle, and he had a tangle of gray
      whisker and beard on top of him that made him look like a window-mop. He
      fell down when she hit him. She kicked him with the point of a little
      shoe, and he came up, unfolding in sections like a carpenter&rsquo;s two-foot
      rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slap this man&rsquo;s face, Ike, and send him along about his business,&rdquo; she
      commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he only teetered and grinned and drooled, and winked at me over her
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are only another drunken fool!&rdquo; she raged; and she stretched on
      tiptoe, and beat his face with the flat of her hand. &ldquo;You have stood here
      without putting up a finger to help me get him off that turn-table, where
      he&rsquo;s disgracing himself. I wonder whether there are any real men left in
      San Francisco!&rdquo; She was in such a state of mind that I was mighty ashamed
      by then, I tell you that!
    </p>
    <p>
      I dropped my baggage and took off my hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about San Francisco and the real men, miss,&rdquo; I told
      her, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;ve been in town only about five minutes. I reckon it makes an
      Easterner dizzy to be rushed in and dropped here. I didn&rsquo;t mean to make
      trouble for you. Seeing that I&rsquo;ve made it, I&rsquo;ll unmake it if I can. Do you
      want your father&mdash;saying it is your father&mdash;brought off that
      turn-table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she snapped, still spiteful and all worked up. &ldquo;I want you to think
      up something else for him to do on there as soon as he gets tired of doing
      what you suggested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, it was up to me to butt into that affair still farther&mdash;I could
      see that. I couldn&rsquo;t sneak off and leave that girl feeling that way about
      me. I hopped on to the moving turn-table, took father by the arm, and told
      him his daughter wanted him to come along. He braced himself and shook
      loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nossir,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve paid my money, and I&rsquo;ll stay aboard till I get to
      where I&rsquo;m bound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, you are not getting anywhere, man. You are only riding around
      and around, making a show of yourself, and there&rsquo;s your nice daughter
      waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no place for a daughter&mdash;going where I&rsquo;m going. Daughter ought
      to be in bed.&rdquo; And then he braced himself back still farther, and&mdash;well,
      I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to call it &ldquo;singing&rdquo; in order to describe the sound:=
    </p>
    <p>
      ````"I&rsquo;m bound for the foot of Telegraph Hill,
    </p>
    <p>
      `````To the Barbary Coast so gay.
    </p>
    <p>
      ````I&rsquo;m starting there for a peach of a tear&mdash;fill
    </p>
    <p>
      `````&rsquo;Em up all round&mdash;hooray!&rdquo;=
    </p>
    <p>
      I took hold of his arm once more, and it was some arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he snarled, squinting at me, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you are, but
      I&rsquo;ll let you know who I am blamed quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know just what he might have done to me if he had been sober&mdash;but
      he wasn&rsquo;t sober. I was, and my line of work had made me lithe and quick. I
      snapped my man before he had time to open his mouth, and ran him off that
      turn-table and presented him to his daughter with my compliments. He
      kicked and thrashed around in a logy style, and I kept him circling so
      that he could not get foothold, on the same principle that you keep a
      boa-constrictor from hooking his tail around a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where will you have him delivered, miss?&rdquo; I asked, as politely as I
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, you come along with me this instant!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want
      strangers interfering in our affairs any longer.&rdquo; She said that to him for
      my benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to be interfering, miss,&rdquo; I pleaded. &ldquo;I only want to square
      myself for being thoughtless and starting trouble for you&mdash;more
      trouble, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her hand against me and pushed me away from her father&mdash;no, I
      can hardly say that I was pushed away. That hand was too little to push a
      man of my size. But the gesture of pushing was enough for me. I let him
      loose. She reached for his ear, but he dodged away, cantering like a
      cart-horse, and whooped that he was bound for the &ldquo;Barbary Coast.&rdquo; The
      human belay-ing-pin with the oakum topknot followed, plainly relishing the
      fact that the procession had started. The girl took a few steps in
      pursuit, and then she stopped and began to cry. She had grit&mdash;I had
      seen that&mdash;but after a girl gets about so mad she has to cry on
      general principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; I told her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a stranger, all right, but you need a man&rsquo;s
      help right now. I&rsquo;ll help for every ounce that&rsquo;s in me if you&rsquo;ll say the
      word. But I&rsquo;m a Yankee and I need to be asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a lot of money in his pockets,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;He must pay out that
      money to-morrow morning. He will be butchered and robbed where he&rsquo;s going.
      I never saw him so silly and obstinate before. His head has been turned by
      some good luck which has come to him. He&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got time to listen to details, miss. He&rsquo;s getting out of sight.
      I&rsquo;ve got to work quick. I&rsquo;m square and decent and honest, and I&rsquo;m mighty
      sorry for the scrape you are in. Do you want me to chase that father of
      yours for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she gasped; &ldquo;yes, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About all I&rsquo;m worth in the world is in that bag there. It&rsquo;s my
      diving-dress. I&rsquo;ve got to leave it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name is Sidney!&rdquo; she cried, her eyes opening wide on me. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the
      man we came to meet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, after all, I had butted in on my reception committee! &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s
      Captain Holstrom?&rdquo; I demanded, pointing up the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Yes! Hurry, sir. I will watch your bag! I will stay here. Hurry,
      sir! He has gone up Market Street, but he&rsquo;ll turn to the right pretty
      soon. That&rsquo;s the way to the horrible Barbary Coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I patted her shoulder&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t help it. She looked up at me
      through her tears. And off I hiked, leaving my earthly possessions in
      charge of a girl whom I had met for the first time less than ten minutes
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, I knew what every one knows, whether he has been in San
      Francisco or not, that Market Street cuts straight across the city from
      bay to ocean. But at just what street on the course Captain Rask Holstrom
      proceeded to port his helm and swing to starboard blessed if I had the
      least idea. I didn&rsquo;t know the name of another street in the city. I knew
      what the Barbary Coast was in San Francisco. I had read descriptions of
      its dance-halls, its dens, its haunts of iniquity, and its dangers. And
      here I was, galloping straight toward it before the creases of a railroad
      journey across the continent were out of my clothes. That is to say, I
      hoped I was galloping toward it, for I wanted to catch father for that
      nice girl. Captain Holstrom was out of sight among the crowds on that long
      Market Street before I had started the chase. I didn&rsquo;t dare to run too
      fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      San Francisco, as I have said, seemed to be inclined to let a man tend to
      his own business, but I didn&rsquo;t want to provoke some ass to start a &ldquo;stop
      thief&rdquo; yell behind me. I craned and peered ahead as I trotted on. I
      stopped for a moment at the head of streets which led away to the right&mdash;the
      girl had said he would turn to the right&mdash;but I caught no glimpse of
      a bobbing blue cap nor of a lofty thatch of grizzled beard and whisker.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a chance after a while, for Market Street showed ahead an upward
      slope and I couldn&rsquo;t spot my man there. I turned off to the right, and
      hurried. I didn&rsquo;t know what street I was on. I came to a square at last
      where there were a statue and a fountain, and there were large buildings
      on the right. I ran across the square, and the next moment I realized that
      I was in Chinatown&mdash;and I had read of that part of San Francisco,
      too. I knew then that I was headed toward the Barbary Coast all right,
      having a memory of what I had read. But in a few minutes I was lost in a
      maze of narrow streets which traveled up and down the little hills. I was
      peering and goggling here and there. I must have looked like a tourist
      trying to do Chinatown in record time. I came into a street or alley that
      was roofed&mdash;and I came out again, for it seemed to be closed in at
      the upper end. By that time I realized that not only had I lost Capt. Rask
      Holstrom, but that I had also succeeded in losing myself&mdash;a rather
      silly predicament for a young man who so boldly offered himself as knight
      errant to a damsel in distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood still and wiped sweat out of my eyes, and addressed a few pregnant
      remarks to myself on the subject of a man&rsquo;s making a fool of himself for a
      woman. However, I had a mighty good reason of my own for wanting to meet
      up with Captain Holstrom&mdash;and to safeguard that money of his, for I
      hoped to rake some of it down in wages.

      &ldquo;Do I know&mdash;Oh, come now! Why, say, I live over that way,&rdquo; he snarled
      through the corner of his mouth; and he looked at me as though I had
      insulted his intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided that I would be plain and direct with that chap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the trail of a steamboat captain by the name of Holstrom, and he
      is two-thirds pickled, and has money on him. Do you think you know the
      places where a man like that would be likely to drop in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the lay&mdash;a touch and a divvy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the kind. I&rsquo;m his friend, and I want to catch him and take him
      home out of trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same old stall,&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to let me be a friend, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I reached out and got my crowbar clutch on that fellow. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose
      you ever had a man tell you the truth, son,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;m not going to
      blame you much. I say that I&rsquo;m after this man to take him home to his
      daughter. That&rsquo;s truth, and it&rsquo;s on my say-so. If you propose to call me a
      liar, out with it, and we&rsquo;ll settle the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She stands as you say&mdash;and you needn&rsquo;t pinch so,&rdquo; he whined.
    </p>
    <p>
      There&rsquo;s nothing like a good grip to press home conviction in a sneak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you ten dollars if you&rsquo;ll locate that man for me before the
      evening is over,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it twenty dollars if you&rsquo;ll turn
      the trick inside of an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all the joints&mdash;I know the steamboat hangouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to be an easy trick. He is with an old belay-ing-pin who has
      enough hair on his head and face to stuff a bolster&mdash;and I heard
      somebody call him Ike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, that&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ingot Ike.&rsquo; Everybody between Dupont Street and Telegraph
      Hill knows that old hornbeam and his everlasting hum about three million
      dollars&rsquo; worth of buried gold ingots. Come along! I ought to pull down
      that twenty easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me tell you one thing,&rdquo; I said, chasing along with him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
      worth robbing. I&rsquo;m going to keep close to you, and if you put me against
      any frame-up I&rsquo;ll get you first, and I&rsquo;ll get you quick.&rdquo; And I grabbed
      him by the wrist and let him have that honest old grip once more. I kept
      hold of him. And led thus like a blind man through this street and that,
      by short cuts along dark alleys, across courts, and now and then skirting
      vacant lots, we came at last into purlieus that my ears, eyes, and nose
      told me must be that &ldquo;Barbary Coast so gay,&rdquo; as Captain Holstrom had
      caroled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of open doors came liquor fumes and music blended, if there is any
      such thing as blending noise and odors; the two seemed to be associated
      there so regularly and invariably that my senses told me that they were
      blended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women sauntered on the sidewalks; the men loafed there. We two seemed
      to be about the only ones who were headed for something definite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tap the regular joints first,&rdquo; said Beason. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s pretty drunk
      he won&rsquo;t be using his mind much to think up new places to go. He&rsquo;ll fall
      into the rut like a ball in a crooked pin-game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was young enough to be interested in that panorama of iniquity. I would
      have gaped longer than I did in those places, but Mr. Beason proved to be
      a very active guide. That matter of twenty dollars proved to be like a bur
      under a bronco&rsquo;s saddle. He would gallop into a place, leave me to goggle
      at the antics on the dance floor; he would weasel his way through the
      crowd, chop out a few staccato questions, and then yank me out with my
      eyes behind me and my chin hanging over my shoulder like the tailboard of
      a cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beason rattled me down another length of street&mdash;and if the folks we
      bumped hadn&rsquo;t known him I reckon we would have had a few things on our
      hands besides that man hunt. They all seemed to know Beason. He snapped
      questions right and left.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once my guide got a clue. He barked a few more questions at this
      illuminative party, and turned and scooted back along our trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old cuss has taken to a back room,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;I ought to have
      figured that he would be hiding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rushed me around comers, across streets, down alleys, and into more
      streets. We came up against a saloon at last where the front window was
      lettered in red paint, &ldquo;Holding Ground Cove.&rdquo; Knowing, as a deep-sea
      diver, that a good holding ground means a mud bottom, I could have thought
      up a highly moral and somewhat humorous apothegm on that name for a saloon
      if I had had the time; but Mr. Beason was cutting comers on Time that
      night. He rushed me into the saloon, into a back room at the rear, and
      when he didn&rsquo;t see what we were looking for up-stairs we went. There were
      cribs of private rooms, furnished with bare tables and hard chairs&mdash;drinking-rooms.
      From the half-open door of one came the cackle of much laughter, and we
      peeped in.
    </p>
    <p>
      A girl, whose face was painted in almost as gaudy hues as her red
      stockings, was standing on a table in the middle of the little room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. Rask Holstrom was seated in a chair, straddling the back, and was
      busily engaged in tickling the girl&rsquo;s nose with the tip of a very long
      peacock feather&mdash;and wherever he secured that feather I never found
      out. But always leave it to a hilarious drunken man to find something odd
      to carry around with him. In the room was the human belaying-pin, also
      seated. But his chair had evidently slipped from under him when he tried
      to lean against the wall, and he was jack-knifed down in a corner, with
      his broomstick legs waving in the air, and was surveying the scene between
      that frame. He was squealing laughter in a key that would have put a
      guinea-hen out of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Ingot Ike,&rdquo; affirmed Beason, &ldquo;and if t&rsquo;other one is your
      pertickler friend then I&rsquo;ll cash in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held up his cheap watch, with his dirty forefinger indicating the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I get the twenty with nine minutes&rsquo; &lsquo;velvet,&rsquo; if that&rsquo;s your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Captain Holstrom did not display any very ardent friendship for any
      one just then. He turned an especially malevolent stare in my direction
      and poised his peacock feather like lance in rest. I could see that
      something was going to break loose there mighty soon, and after what I had
      told Beason I didn&rsquo;t want that young sneak to overhear. It would be like
      him to come back with a gang and &ldquo;do&rdquo; me on the excuse that I was a
      stranger who was &ldquo;frsking&rdquo; Captain Holstrom for his pocketful.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hauled out two ten-dollar bills mighty quick, and passed them to Beason.
      He held one in each hand, pinched between thumb and forefinger, and looked
      at them in turn, wrinkling his nose with as much disgust as though he were
      holding lizards by the tails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soft money,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and the stink of the East still on it! I&rsquo;ll bet
      you both of these poultices that you haven&rsquo;t been in San Francisco
      twenty-four hours&mdash;and how do you happen to be such a pertickler
      friend of a China Basin steamboat cap&rsquo;n, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A freshly arrived Easterner is always given away by his paper money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a friend?&rdquo; inquired Captain Holstrom, the one eye I could see as
      staring and as baleful as the &ldquo;eye&rdquo; on the peacock feather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look-a-here,&rdquo; said I, bracing up to him savagely, for I knew that soft
      soap wouldn&rsquo;t grease the ways, &ldquo;I want to know what you mean by running
      away from me after my telegrams to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I whirled on Beason, pushed him out of the room, and slammed the door in
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been paid,&rdquo; I yelled at him through the crack. &ldquo;Now, keep your
      nose out of the rest of the thing, or I&rsquo;ll pinch it off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; growled Captain Holstrom, vibrating the feather as menacingly
      as though it were a sled stake, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know a private party when you
      see one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I walked right up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Sidney. I&rsquo;m the diver you are expecting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar,&rdquo; he returned, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you you were down to the ferry to meet me. I pulled you off that
      turn-table!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Ross Sidney, I say! You&rsquo;re expecting me. I&rsquo;m a diver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he did not show the least evidence of understanding what I was talking
      about. It&rsquo;s a familiar phase of drunkenness in many men&mdash;that dogged
      determination to hang on to one notion and admit no others.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head and waggled the feather under the girl&rsquo;s nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a private party,&rdquo; he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your daughter is waiting for you&mdash;she is very much worried about
      you and the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, who does this money and this daughter and this room here belong to,
      anyway? Who do I belong to? Who am I? Ain&rsquo;t I Rask Holstrom, fifty-six
      years old, and fully able to take care of myself anywhere between Point
      Lobo and India Basin?&rdquo; He squinted at me along the peacock&rsquo;s plume. &ldquo;Who
      are <i>you?</i> You say my girl is at the ferry, hey? How do you know she
      is there?&rdquo; He leaned back in his chair, dropped the feather, and yanked a
      canvas bag from the right-hand pocket of his trousers. It was a plump bag,
      and a heavy bag, and it plainly contained hard money. He banged it down on
      the table with such a thump that the girl hopped and squealed, and it
      barely missed her toes. He pulled another canvas bag from the left-hand
      pocket, and crashed that down. This time he connected with the girl&rsquo;s
      toes. She screamed in pain, leaped down from the table, and began to hop
      around the room, kicking her foot out behind her. She stumbled into a
      corner, braced herself there, and began to swear volubly, clutching the
      tip of her faded red-velvet slipper in both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not broken in on his monologue. I could not match him in roaring.
      Then for the first time he seemed to note that the girl was not in an
      amiable state of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve insulted my lady friend. I&rsquo;ll have your life for that!&rdquo; He plunged
      out of his chair and drove against the wall in his unsteadiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was profanely advising me&mdash;no, entreating me&mdash;to kill
      the &ldquo;drunken fool.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t blame her for her fire, and I could excuse
      her language. To shift from a tickling under the chin to a mally-hackling
      of toes was a little too strong for a woman&rsquo;s nature even if the toes had
      been cracked with money.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was no time for fine figuring as to ways, means, or chances. Before
      Captain Holstrom recovered his balance I grabbed his sacks and stuffed
      them into my pockets. I started for the door. I had a sort of muddled
      memory of a maxim, or proverb, or something of the kind which says that
      &ldquo;where a man&rsquo;s treasure is there will his heart be also.&rdquo; It occurred to
      me that Captain Holstrom&rsquo;s body would go with his heart if I made off with
      that money, and I preferred to have the body chase me on two legs rather
      than be lugged on my shoulders. If he would chase me back to the ferry the
      situation would be simplified. Of course, mine was a crazy expedient,
      considering the place where I was, but it was a crazy evening, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not stealing it,&rdquo; I yelled at him as I opened the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
      give it to your girl, and if you run hard enough you&rsquo;ll see me give it to
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had plenty of help in opening that door. There were men outside who
      helped me so promptly and unanimously that it was evident they had been
      lying in wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of them grabbed me by the neck as they would have clutched a bat stick
      in choosing sides in a game of three old cat. They rammed me back into the
      room. There were three other men who came in, and one of them was that rat
      of a Beason.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all talking at one another, and Beason was spitting words the
      fastest. But Captain Holstrom drowned out all other sounds by a bellow of
      delight. He knew these men, all right. He seemed especially tickled to
      behold the two men who held me. He slapped them on their backs, cuffed
      their faces with drunken affection, and adjured them to hold me tighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took my money! He stole it! He insulted a lady friend of mine. He&rsquo;s
      been chasing me and picking a row with me for three days,&rdquo; he lied, or
      else the rum he had been drinking had elongated his notions of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I get your twenty, Mr. Keedy,&rdquo; insisted Beason. &ldquo;I told you
      straight. I called the turn on this fly guy. He&rsquo;s what I told you he was.
      You just heard what the captain said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was mighty busy just then with the two men who were holding me, and
      Captain Holstrom was giving me some slaps which were drunkenly heavy, but
      not affectionate. However, I heard what Beason said, and I saw the man
      whom he called Keedy pass over a twenty-dollar gold piece. Beason grinned
      at me and scuttled out of the room. The Keedy person pushed the scolding
      girl out after him and slammed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not like the looks of the Keedy person&mdash;no, not at all. I may
      have instinct in such matters; I don&rsquo;t know. A diver is obliged to do most
      of his work in pitch darkness and by the sense of touch, and such work may
      develop instinct in general. I won&rsquo;t stop to discuss the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that yellow face with a black mustache smacked across it like a smear
      of paint, and arrows of eyebrows shooting up northeast and northwest from
      a regular gouge of a wrinkle between the man&rsquo;s eyes wasn&rsquo;t the kind of
      physog worn by the deacon who takes up the collection in a Sunday-school.
      He stood with back against the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go through him, gents,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;And hand me the gun when you come
      to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There wasn&rsquo;t any gun, but they got the two sacks of gold, and my little
      stock of paper money as well. Then they gave me a shove into a corner, and
      all of them stood off and looked at me. The excitement had brought old
      Ingot Ike on to his feet and he joined the ring of spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in bad,&rdquo; stated Mr. Keedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence gives consent; so I kept still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is backing you in this job? Where&rsquo;s the rest of your gang? You&rsquo;re in
      here without a gun. Now, where&rsquo;s the main party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The main party,&rdquo; said I, mad enough now to do a little talking, &ldquo;is down
      at the ferry, foot of Market Street. She is that old fool&rsquo;s daughter, and
      she was crying when I left her. I&rsquo;m just in from the East, and when I came
      out on to the street from the ferry this evening, setting foot in San
      Francisco for the first time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar!&rdquo; yelped Captain Holstrom. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been on my trail for
      seven days, and you have just knocked me down when I was entertaining a
      lady friend and wasn&rsquo;t looking. You robbed me. The money was found on you.
      But Rask Holstrom has got friends who won&rsquo;t see him done. Here they are.
      And into the dock you go, blast ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in bad,&rdquo; reiterated the Keedy person, narrowing the crease between
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a friend of Captain Holstrom, see if you can&rsquo;t pound it into
      his head that I&rsquo;m the diver he is expecting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the what? Is your name Sidney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rask,&rdquo; snapped Keedy at last, &ldquo;were you down at the ferry turn-table as
      this man says? You&rsquo;ve been pretty drunk. This thing here is taking a new
      tack. I&rsquo;d like to believe this chap here if I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might have been there,&rdquo; owned up the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Was</i> there,&rdquo; stated that old fool of an Ike, who had been standing
      by without a word in my behalf. Now he was ready and willing to leap with
      the popular side. &ldquo;I was there with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was your daughter there with you? Did you leave her there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom looked a little ashamed, and hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was there,&rdquo; stated Ike. &ldquo;She was following us and trying to get my
      noble cap&rsquo;n to go along with her, but it wasn&rsquo;t right to bother my noble
      cap&rsquo;n when he was happy over a lucky trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two of you must have been good and fine,&rdquo; growled Mr. Keedy. &ldquo;Look
      here, Cap, I believe this gent is telling a lot of the truth about you. No
      matter now about his high jinks with the coin. I want to believe what he
      says. As your partner, Captain Holstrom, my advice to you is to hustle
      out, get a cab, and get to that ferry station in quick time. If that
      diving-suit is there bring it back here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain rolled out of the room, growling, but subdued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keedy gave me what was for him an affable smile, a hitching up nearer
      to his nose of that paint-streak mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may as well start in an acquaintance,&rdquo; he said. He passed my
      pocket-book back. &ldquo;My name is Marcena Keedy, partner of Cap&rsquo;n Holstrom.
      Step up here, gents,&rdquo; he commanded the two men who had squatted my
      windpipe. &ldquo;This is Number-one Jones; this is Number-two Jones.&rdquo; They
      ducked salute. They had paint-brush chin beards and cock eyes, and were
      evidently twins. &ldquo;First and second mates, new hired for the <i>Zizania</i>.&rdquo;
       He did not bother to introduce Ingot Ike.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed a button on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take something to gum the edges of sociability, gents. There&rsquo;s
      nothing like gents starting in sociable when they can, and staying
      sociable as long as they can, providing any gent proves himself all right,
      as he says he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave me a significant and mighty sharp look, sat down, and jigged one
      leg over the other, trying hard to keep up his affable smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      We kept on being sociable for half an hour or more.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last back came Capt. Rask Holstrom. He was tugging my duffle-bag, and
      on his heels was his daughter. She had my little valise. She did not show
      any especial symptoms of embarrassment at being in such a joint alone with
      men. She walked straight to me and gave me the valise. What was better,
      she gave me a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I misunderstood you, sir, on short acquaintance,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope you
      will excuse me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked me straight in the eyes without coquetry, a gaze as level and
      candid as that of man to man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gulped some reply&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what. I wasn&rsquo;t half as cool as she
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keedy right now put that yellow face between us. The affable smile wasn&rsquo;t
      there. I got a quick and sharp impression that he didn&rsquo;t relish the way
      the girl and I were getting chummy. She was putting out her hand to me,
      for I had made a motion as though to shake on our general understanding.
      He took her hand and whirled her around and pointed to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better sit down, Kama dear. We&rsquo;re going to talk a little business,
      and you can listen, for you are too much father&rsquo;s girl to be kept out of
      any deal of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pulled her hand out of his, but she went and sat down without shaking
      my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s girl sees more clearly every day that he needs a guardian,&rdquo; she
      said, with a rather hard laugh. &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Keedy, but I do not need
      your invitation to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom looked very sheepish. It was plain that he had been
      listening to some plain and frank opinions on his way back from the ferry
      station.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to act unconcerned, and spying the drink I had not touched,
      started to lift it to his lips. His daughter snatched it away and sprayed
      the liquor on the wall. He sat down, coughing behind his hand. I had seen
      men like Capt. Rask Holstrom before&mdash;a bully and a braggart among
      men, but half a fool where women were concerned&mdash;pliable in the hands
      of the loose female, and mortally afraid of his own womenkind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men in the room were silent for some time. Keedy was looking at
      Holstrom; then his eyes fell on my canvas sack at Holstrom&rsquo;s feet. He
      spoke to me in almost the same fawning tone he had used with the girl. It
      was that almost indescribable air&mdash;that cheap assumption of gentility
      that a professional gambler uses when he is prosecuting his business, and
      it rather jars on an honest man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it would be almighty interesting to me and to these other gents
      and the lady to see an Eastern divingsuit. I reckon you&rsquo;re pretty much up
      to date back there.&rdquo; Liar and knave himself, he wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure I had
      been telling the truth. He wanted to see the goods. But I did not mind
      much. I knelt on the floor, and opened the sack and dug out the equipment.
      This yam of mine goes back before the days of the compressed-air chamber
      which the modern diver carries on his back just as an automobile carries
      fuel. But I had a mighty good suit, almost a new one. There wasn&rsquo;t a dent
      in the helmet or a patch oh the rubber or canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have had a long talk, this gent and I,&rdquo; said Keedy, after he had
      squatted like a frog and had peered at all I had to show him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      naturally a man to get to cases quick. I&rsquo;m open and free with them I take
      a liking to.&rdquo; He went to the door and peeked into the corridor.
      &ldquo;Number-two Jones, you stand here and keep an eye and ear out,&rdquo; he
      directed. &ldquo;Now, Brother Sidney, you Eastern chaps are apt to be pretty
      cold-blooded, and you need first-hand evidence. I&rsquo;m going to open up to
      you one of the biggest prospects you ever heard of&mdash;reckoning that,
      as a human being, you simply can&rsquo;t resist coming into it. If you don&rsquo;t see
      fit to come in after it has been opened up to you&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo; He
      scowled at me like a demon, snapped his fingers above his head, and turned
      on old Ike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up and take the floor,&rdquo; he directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First-hand evidence is what counts,&rdquo; went on Mr. Keedy. &ldquo;Now, here&rsquo;s a
      man who has told his story over a lot of times on the water-front. He has
      told it so many times it has grown to be a joke. They&rsquo;ve given him the
      nickname of &lsquo;Ingot Ike.&rsquo; Lots of big things in this world have been buried
      under a joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned back in his chair and twisted up the ends of his mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Court is open for first-hand evidence, gents. Ike is the first witness.
      I&rsquo;m going to ask him questions and make him answer snappy, for if he ever
      gets to rambling on this story of his he&rsquo;ll make it longer than a dime
      novel. Look-a-here, Ike, what was the steamer <i>Golden Gate?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passengers, bullion in ingots, and general cargo &rsquo;tween here and
      Panama.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was rather comical to see that old bean-pole straighten up and try to
      imitate the snappy style of Mr. Keedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was your job aboard of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quartermaster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caught fire off coast of Mexico when she was bound for Panama, beached
      well north of Acapulco, rolled over and over in surf, what was left of
      her, and bones still there. Three ribs show at low tide if you know where
      to look for &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was she carrying for treasure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over three million dollars&rsquo; worth of gold in ingots in her strong-room
      abaft second bulkhead, between pantry and boiler-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the treasure ever recovered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wreck was abandoned to underwriters, and after underwriters had worked
      for a long time, keeping very mysterious, they reported that they had got
      the ingots all out of her. Then they came away. Everybody believed that
      the underwriters had cleaned out the wreck, just as they reported they
      had. But I was in that wrecking crew. I kept my eye out. It was a bluff
      about getting that treasure.&rdquo; The old man began to show excitement. &ldquo;Their
      divers couldn&rsquo;t get at it. They didn&rsquo;t have nerve, and they didn&rsquo;t have
      the right outfits in those days. The underwriters didn&rsquo;t want it shown
      that they hadn&rsquo;t pulled up the stuff. They knew that every Tom, Dick, and
      Harry would go down there, peeking and poking around that wreck, and that
      some fellow might think up a way to call the turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they bribed the divers, and the divers brought up fake boxes of gold,
      and the report was made that all the treasure had been taken from the <i>Golden
      Gate</i> wreck. But it&rsquo;s all there, gents. The underwriters haven&rsquo;t been
      able yet to think of a sensible way of getting at it. They don&rsquo;t want to
      make another splurge and attract attention till they&rsquo;re sure of what
      they&rsquo;re doing. Them&rsquo;s facts what I&rsquo;m telling. I know. I haven&rsquo;t done much
      of anything but keep tabs. I don&rsquo;t care if they do call me Ingot Ike. I
      know what I&rsquo;m talking about. The trouble down there has been that the old
      Pacific has rolled on and rolled in and piled up sand over that treasure,
      and they didn&rsquo;t know how to handle the proposition in those days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea is, Brother Sidney,&rdquo; broke in Keedy, &ldquo;firsthand evidence informs
      us that three or four millions are cached in a place we know of. Now,
      because man has failed once, years ago, when man wasn&rsquo;t as bright as he is
      now, is that any sign that man shall give up? Captain Holstrom and I say,
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; We&rsquo;re partners. We have been talking over this proposition for a
      long time. Now, up to date, are you in any way interested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was, and I said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There they lie,&rdquo; said Keedy, &ldquo;bars of yellow gold. Boxes and boxes of
      shiny gold. More than three million dollars&rsquo; worth of finest gold&mdash;and
      only a little water and sand over &rsquo;em. No bars to break through, no
      vaults to drill. Only sand and water&mdash;and we ought to be able to
      match that sand with grit, and the water with good red blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There are some men who can talk about money, and it will not start a
      thrill in you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marcena Keedy could talk about gold in a way to make your soul hungry. He
      rolled the sound in his mouth&mdash;a big, round, juicy sound&mdash;as a
      boy sucks a candy marble. It made the moisture ooze in my own mouth to
      hear him talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keedy gave over leaning back in his chair. He sat on the edge of it,
      and leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s right at this point that we go into this thing clear to the necks,
      my friend. I have studied men a lot in my life. I can see about what kind
      of a fellow you are. If another fellow opens up to you in honest fashion
      you are <i>with</i> him&mdash;and if you can&rsquo;t stay with him you are not
      going off and squeal and hurt him. There&rsquo;s nothing half-way between
      Holstrom, here, and myself. We&rsquo;re partners. We&rsquo;re in together, whole hog.
      I&rsquo;ll spread the cards for you just as they are spread for the captain and
      myself. He and I have been having a run of good luck to date in our
      partnership. We&rsquo;ll have some more firsthand evidence. Rask, how was it you
      got the inside clinch in the <i>Zizania</i> matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the benefit of a man from the East, where they ain&rsquo;t as shrewd as the
      Yankees think they be,&rdquo; stated Captain Holstrom in his husky voice, &ldquo;I
      will say that we&rsquo;ve got a devilish good close combine on the waterfront&mdash;we
      fellows have been on the job for a long time. When the Government auctions
      off anything we get together and fix the top price at which any bid shall
      go, and then we cut the cards to settle who shall pick the plum at that
      price. It means that the lucky man will pick a bargain, don&rsquo;t forget that.
      Price can&rsquo;t be budged above that bid&mdash;and it&rsquo;s a blamed measly
      price.&rdquo; He smacked his lips. &ldquo;So that is how I have got hold of the old
      __Zizania__, Government lighthouse-tender and buoy steamer, side-wheeler,
      one hundred and seventy feet long, new derricks, boilers in fair shape,
      and engine fresh overhauled. I&rsquo;ve cut the cards for eleven years, and this
      has been my first look-in. But it&rsquo;s worth waiting for. I could junk her
      and make four times what I pay for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>we</i> pay for her,&rdquo; corrected Mr. Keedy. &ldquo;Remember that I&rsquo;m your
      partner. Now I&rsquo;ll take the stand myself. Holstrom here sold his tugboat
      the minute he struck luck on the <i>Zizania</i>. He pulled what money he
      had in the bank. He lacked half the price, at that. He was going to borrow
      on a bill of sale. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; says I to him. &lsquo;Bring along your cash to the
      place where I&rsquo;m dealing faro. I&rsquo;ll go in partner with you and double your
      pot.&rsquo; Holstrom knew that when I talked that way with him I was square.
      Some men would have double-crossed him and pulled the pickings for the
      bank. I ain&rsquo;t that kind,&rdquo; declared Mr. Keedy, pulling himself up
      virtuously and giving the girl a side-glance. &ldquo;I know who my friends are,
      and who I&rsquo;d like to help. And I can deal faro! Don&rsquo;t worry about that!
      Captain Holstrom walked out with his pot doubled. The money goes down on
      the <i>Zizania</i> to-morrow morning, making up the balance after the
      forfeit money was paid. That&rsquo;s the way Holstrom and I do business after we
      have come to an agreement.&rdquo; He gave the girl a look which he intended to
      be melting. &ldquo;I said I&rsquo;d do it, and I did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed of my father,&rdquo; she said, crisply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much blame you, Kama,&rdquo; stammered Captain Holstrom, missing the
      point of her rebuke. &ldquo;For me to go and do what I done after scooping in
      that money was a fool performance, and I ask the pardon of all concerned.
      But I reckon my head was turned by having all that good luck come in a
      bunch. I just went into the air, that&rsquo;s what I done. But I&rsquo;m back on earth
      to stay now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hope so, partner,&rdquo; chided Kir. Keedy. &ldquo;That crazy Beason and our
      new friend here made such a racket chasing you through the Coast that I
      heard of it, and started out on the chase myself. It has turned out lucky,
      but that&rsquo;s no credit to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl stood up. &ldquo;I have listened, and now I understand. If you want to
      keep my respect, father, you&rsquo;ll hand back the part of that money which is
      stolen, and borrow enough to make your payment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, Miss Kama!&rdquo; cried Keedy. &ldquo;That money wasn&rsquo;t stolen. A man who
      tackles a faro-bank isn&rsquo;t stealing if he wins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard what you said a few minutes ago, Mr. Keedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I said it to show I can be a friend to those I like. I&rsquo;ve known you a
      long time, and now when I&rsquo;ve had a chance to show you that I&rsquo;m a friend
      you can&rsquo;t afford to chuck me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jumped up and went near to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more faro for me&mdash;no cards any more,&rdquo; he said, dusting his hands
      before her. &ldquo;I know you haven&rsquo;t liked to have me do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never made any remarks to you about your affairs, Mr. Keedy. It&rsquo;s
      only when my father gets mixed into them that I protest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon that after all the years I&rsquo;ve dealt crooked for the sake of the
      bank I&rsquo;ve got the right to deal crooked for once in my life to help my
      friends,&rdquo; muttered Keedy. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m all done with faro, I tell you, Kama.
      We&rsquo;re all going to be rich. I want you to remember that I&rsquo;ve done my full
      share in this thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom banged the sacks of coin upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet you have, Marcena. And you&rsquo;re my partner. I stand by you. I never
      saw a girl yet who didn&rsquo;t have foolish notions. But they grow out of
      them.&rdquo; He winked at Keedy. &ldquo;This money goes down on the old <i>Zizania</i>
      to-morrow morning. She&rsquo;s ours from snout to tail&mdash;from keelson to
      pennant block. And she&rsquo;s going to make our everlasting fortunes. You shall
      see, Kama, my girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she stood there, her eyes narrowed, her cheeks flaming up, as
      fine a picture of protesting and indignant maidenhood as I ever laid eyes
      on. Then she compressed her lips and choked back an outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I <i>shall</i> see,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;For I shall go on board the
      <i>Zizania</i>, and stay there and watch you, father, and try to keep you
      out of State&rsquo;s prison for the sake of my poor dead mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been all right for you to live with me aboard the tug,&rdquo; growled
      Captain Holstrom, blinking sourly at her. &ldquo;But this is a different
      proposition. This is going to be a man&rsquo;s game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With one woman along,&rdquo; she insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have got to stay here in the city,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you leave me here alone, deserting me for men who are leading you into
      dangers and trouble, you&rsquo;ll find me dancing in one of the worst holes on
      this street when you come back. I swear it!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not raise her voice. There was no elocution, and hysterics were
      absent. But there are women who can say a thing and make you believe it.
      Captain Holstrom cracked his knuckles and gasped, and said nothing. Keedy
      ran his thin tongue along the line of his sooty mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a partner, I&rsquo;m in favor of keeping a good girl near her father,&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not a partner in my family affairs, Mr. Keedy!&rdquo; cried the girl,
      hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keedy, much embarrassed, and willing to hide his feelings, turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We seem to be drifting off the main subject, Brother Sidney.&rdquo; I wanted to
      yank him up for calling me by that title&mdash;resentment surged in me as
      hotly as it did in the girl. There are some men who seem to make your soul
      feel sticky when they try to be intimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him I&rsquo;d like a night to think the matter over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Keedy, dryly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you with me to a place where
      you can do some steady thinking and won&rsquo;t be bothered. Stuff your things
      back into your bag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I plodded along the narrow street with him, my sack propped on my
      shoulder, Captain Holstrom and his daughter passed me in a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keedy&rsquo;s voice and manner were well padded with velvet that night, but
      he couldn&rsquo;t fool me. He caged me&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he did. I remember that
      I slept in a closet of a room, and, Mr. Keedy was on a cot in the room
      which opened into the hall. I didn&rsquo;t mind any of his precautions. I had
      made up my mind to go along. I was dog-tired and slept all night.

      XXVIII&mdash;SORTING THE CHECKER-BOARD CREW
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>R. KEEDY evidently
      desired to impress on me that his hankering to make sure of my company
      during the night was inspired by pure and sudden friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came to awaken me his mustache was lifted so high in an amiable
      smile that the twin sooty wings seemed to stick out of his nostrils. He
      hoped I was getting to like the West and the folks there. I returned that
      up to date I had not been homesick&mdash;a conservative statement, and
      true; I had had no time to be homesick.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paid for my breakfast; further evidence of friendship. Then he called a
      cab and took me and my belongings down to the berth of the <i>Zizania</i>.
      The old steamer was docked in a place which, so he told me, was the China
      Basin, and we wormed our way through alleys and junk-piles and got aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hadn&rsquo;t hurried that morning, and the time was well into the middle of
      the forenoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom was stubbing to and fro on the main deck. He wore a fine
      air of proprietorship, and welcomed us with a flourish of his hand. He
      patted his breast, and the crackle of paper sounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money paid,&rdquo; he reported. &ldquo;Them&rsquo;s the dockyments. Come up into the
      wheel-house. There&rsquo;s the place to talk the rest of our business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marcena Keedy did most of the talking that forenoon. He loved to lollop
      the words &ldquo;three million dollars&rsquo; worth of gold ingots&rdquo; in his mouth. He
      had wormed out of me at breakfast-time admissions enough so that he knew I
      was favorably disposed. He proposed to try to take advantage of me and I
      saw his game and resolved to do some bluffing on my own part. He put a lot
      of verbal plush around his propositions, but I could feel the hard nub
      just the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all that conversational fluff he wanted me to sign a contract to
      take day&rsquo;s wages for the job&mdash;double pay for the days when I
      recovered any gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned that wages suggestion down, flat and final. You would have
      thought I had money plastered all over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has got to be on shares,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You doggone bean-eater, have you got the nerve to talk shares on an
      investment of a diving-suit against our steamer and our information about
      the <i>Golden Gate?</i>&rdquo; stuttered Keedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the way the thing shakes down, Mr. Keedy. You have made it
      plain to me that you&rsquo;re gambling in this&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t a straight deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swore at me, but I didn&rsquo;t mean the thing the way he cook it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were going down there,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;with a big expedition, and
      proposed to build coffer-dams, and all that, and go at it scientific
      fashion, I would hire as a regular diver. I couldn&rsquo;t demand anything else.
      But I&rsquo;m not merely investing a diving-suit, as it stands. I&rsquo;m playing a
      lone hand in the diving part of the scheme; I&rsquo;m investing all my
      experience, all my skill; I&rsquo;m investing life itself, for, as near as I can
      find out from what you say, it will be up to me to know how to get that
      gold, and then go get it. I want one-third of the velvet after all bills
      are paid, and I want a contract drawn before I start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps I wouldn&rsquo;t have jabbed the thing so hard at Holstrom, but I did
      not propose to be the monkey for Keedy. I looked innocent and suggested
      that they&rsquo;d better talk with another diver. Keedy flapped like a speared
      fish for half an hour&mdash;and then he came over. Captain Holstrom walked
      up and down with his hands behind his back during all the talk. I judged
      from his general air that he was viewing the whole thing as more or less
      of a dream, and did not want to get too wide awake about it from fear of
      losing courage and interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing about it&mdash;you&rsquo;ll work harder if you have a lay,&rdquo;
       said Keedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      That&rsquo;s usually the way with the grafter or loafer&mdash;he&rsquo;s afraid the
      other fellow won&rsquo;t work hard enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankly, I did not have any very brilliant hopes in regard to that
      expedition, for if old Ingot Ike had told the truth about the failure of
      the underwriters, I figured that the diving proposition must be a tough
      one. Keedy was hot about it, for he did not know enough about such work to
      judge chances; as for Captain Holstrom, ever since he had won this <i>Zizania</i>
      elephant he was in a state of mind which made him ready for any project,
      even to putting wings on her and starting for the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to the outfitting, except to make a list of
      such equipment in the way of lines, hose, air-pumps, and such matters as I
      needed for my part of the work. Keedy and Holstrom turned around and
      borrowed money on the security of the steamer, this debt to stand against
      our partnership. Keedy seemed so sure of that gold that he did not stop to
      ask me how I was fixed to stand my share in case of utter failure.
      Therefore, with plenty of funds to work with, we were ready for sea in
      short order, and to sea we went, swashing out past Point Lobos, the
      sea-lions hooting at us as we passed their rocks, and started down the
      coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      I leaned over the rail and watched the shore melt in the hazy distance,
      and did not blame the sea-lions for their derogatory remarks. I did not
      know much about steamers, but I realized that the <i>Zizania</i>,
      condemned Government tub, wasn&rsquo;t anything to brag about. She was a real
      old ocean-walloper, a broad-beamed duck of a thing, thrashing her warped
      paddles, her rusty walking-beam groaning, her patched boilers wheezing&mdash;a
      weather-worn, gray, and grunting ocean tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all craft of the buoy-boat model, she had much deck room forward of
      the bridge, and here were nested, as dories are nested on a Gloucester
      trawler, four forty-foot lighters. Plenty of anchors accompanied these
      scows&mdash;huge, rusty second-hand anchors which Captain Holstrom had
      bought from junkmen. The <i>Zizania</i> was naturally slow, and this load
      forward now made a snail of her. Hawsers and chains encumbered her deck
      space everywhere&mdash;age-blackened ropes, and iron from which rust
      scales were dropping. Captain Holstrom had ransacked the wharfs for
      hand-me-downs. Even the men whom he had shipped looked as though he had
      secured them at a rummage sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a checker-board crew,&rdquo; the captain had informed me as they straggled
      on board. &ldquo;Half black men, and half white. That&rsquo;s the only way to sort men
      when you&rsquo;re bound on a long cruise. Keep the blacks mad with the whites,
      and vitchy vici, and you&rsquo;ve always got half the crew on your side in case
      of trouble. There can&rsquo;t any general mutinies start when you&rsquo;ve got a
      checker-board crew. Number-one Jones has the white men&rsquo;s watch; Number-two
      Jones has the black watch; and as soon as we get this stuff stored and the
      rest moused on deck I&rsquo;ll have Number-one sick his bunch on to
      Number-two&rsquo;s, and let &rsquo;em fight long enough to get good and mad.
      Then they&rsquo;ll sort of neutralize each other for the rest of the cruise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That system of gentle diplomacy was new to me, and I loafed around and
      kept an eye out, for I have always had a hearty relish for an honest
      scrap. Furthermore, in explaining to me later, the captain had stated that
      I was expected to jump in with himself and the mates and break up the
      fight with clubs when it had progressed far enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, we want to leave both sides mad and neither side licked,&rdquo; said
      Captain Holstrom. &ldquo;It will be like cooking in a hot oven. The thing
      mustn&rsquo;t get scorched on. I know how to handle it. Jump in when I say the
      word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had given me these instructions leaning over the sill of the
      pilot-house window soon after we had got away from the dock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that the doodah will start for some time yet,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m a
      great hand to have things all ready and understood. You can be looking up
      your club between now and to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I glanced into the wheel-house as I walked on. Marcena Keedy lounged in
      solitary state on the transom seat at the rear, puffing away at a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always welcome in here,&rdquo; he called. But I had no appetite for the
      companionship of Mr. Keedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to me, with just a bit of relish in the thought, that Miss
      Kama Holstrom probably was of similar mind in regard to Mr. Keedy. She had
      taken a seat in the wheel-house when she had come on board that day. Now
      she was in her state-room, which was the cabin on the upper deck near the
      bridge, planned as the captain&rsquo;s apartment. Either she had pre-empted it
      or Captain Holstrom had assigned her to it. I had seen that the Joneses&mdash;Number-one
      and Number-two&mdash;were in berths near my quarters below, and it was
      plain that partners Holstrom and Keedy had quartered themselves in the
      mates&rsquo; room on the upper deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Holstrom&rsquo;s door was on the hook, and I caught a glimpse of her more
      by accident than by design. She nodded without speaking, and I raised my
      cap and went below to the main deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got there in season to see the lighting of a fuse which exploded Captain
      Holstrom&rsquo;s &ldquo;checker-board&rdquo; plans ahead of scheduled time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first man I met on the deck was Ingot Ike. He was gnawing at a hunk of
      gingerbread with his snags of teeth, and was grinning amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is going to be a comfortable trip for me,&rdquo; he confided. &ldquo;I find I
      know the cook. It&rsquo;s a lucky thing if you stand in well with the cook. Him
      and me was shipmates together on a Vancouver packet. He&rsquo;s the Snohomish
      Glutton.&rdquo; He opened his eyes and looked at me as though he expected that I
      would show astonishment. &ldquo;I said&mdash;he&rsquo;s the Snohomish Glutton,&rdquo; he
      repeated, more loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my face remained blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to tell me that you never heard of the Snohomish Glutton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You nev&mdash;You don&rsquo;t&mdash;You ain&rsquo;t ever&mdash;&rdquo; Ike took another
      drag at the gingerbread, and swallowed hard. &ldquo;Why, the Snohomish Glutton
      is known&mdash;the Snohomish Glutton, he has eat at one setting&mdash;Oh,
      shucks, if you ain&rsquo;t ever heard, what&rsquo;s the use!&rdquo; He started on, but
      whirled and came back and shook the hunk of gingerbread under my nose. &ldquo;I
      suppose if it had been writ and printed in a book you Eastern perfessers
      would know all about it. Thank God, in the West we know a lot of things
      that ain&rsquo;t printed in a book!&rdquo; Then he stumped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I concluded I would stroll along to the galley and take a look at
      the cook, and be able thereafter to say that at least I had seen this
      notable of the Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a spacious galley on the old <i>Zizania</i>. I looked in through
      an open window which commanded the port alley. A fat man was chopping
      kindlings. He was a thing of rolls and folds of fat&mdash;a gob of a man.
      There were narrow slits near his nose marking his eyes, but his eyes
      seemed to be shut by fat. A little, round, pursed-up mouth was in the
      middle of his face, and from this came wheezy grunts as he chopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was watching him, an object bounded into the galley door and
      leapfrogged him, darting past me through the window. Before I could turn
      my head the thing, whatever it was, had disappeared around the corner of
      the alley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook straightened up, and by an effort opened his eyes enough to stare
      at me. I expected a deep, gruff voice, But he had a real tin-whistle pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you throw at me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t throw anything. Something rushed through the galley&mdash;I
      didn&rsquo;t see what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things don&rsquo;t hit a man unless they are thrown,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;I may look
      funny, but I ain&rsquo;t funny. I don&rsquo;t relish having things thrown at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave up trying to hold his eyes open, and went on chopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was getting my breath ready to protest when the thing came through once
      more. It was a monkey. But it missed the cook&rsquo;s back, for the broad
      shoulders heaved as the ax came up. The monkey slipped, slid across the
      chopping-block, and down came the ax. The animal squealed horribly, flung
      itself past me through the open window, and fled. It went like a shot, but
      I got the fleeting impression that its tail was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do then?&rdquo; asked the cook, squinting at me suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I haven&rsquo;t done anything at all. That was a monkey. He came
      from somewhere. He ran through here. I think you have cut off his tail.&rdquo;
       He peered about. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no tail here,&rdquo; he whined. &ldquo;There couldn&rsquo;t
      have been any monkey here. This ain&rsquo;t any place for a monkey to be. There
      may be monkey business here&mdash;and you&rsquo;re getting it up. You go away
      from here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m afraid the Snohomish Glutton and I would have had trouble then and
      there, but just then a man came rushing into the door of the galley. He
      had the monkey under his arm, upside down, and he was pointing quivering
      finger at a bleeding stump of a tail. I couldn&rsquo;t understand what he was
      bawling. I found out afterward that he was a Russian Finn and could
      command only a few English words even when he was perfectly calm. He was
      not calm now. I never heard a man rave so. The monkey joined him with
      hideous screams.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook listened for a time, puckering his fat forehead. When he found
      that the man was talking a foreign language he upraised his ax and swished
      it around in circles near the Finn&rsquo;s head. A cook in his galley is lord
      supreme in his domain, and the sailor probably knew as much. The ax was
      menacing; it was coming very close, and the Finn already had one exhibit
      of that cook&rsquo;s ferocity under his arm. He allowed himself to be backed
      out, and the cook slammed and barred the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; he asked me, in his piping tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckoned it was some kind of Dago swearing, and I don&rsquo;t allow a man to
      swear at me. Most likely it was swearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cut off that monkey&rsquo;s tail,&rdquo; I insisted. &ldquo;I thought so when he
      squealed. Now I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to peering around again, whining to himself like a fat porcupine
      who is being badgered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no tail here. I didn&rsquo;t cut off his tail. I didn&rsquo;t see him so
      that I could cut off his tail.&rdquo; He started toward the window with a look
      as if he proposed to resent my suggestion that he had been cutting off
      monkeys&rsquo; tails. I passed on. I figured that I might as well try to argue
      with a Sussex shote as with that shapeless mass of fat. I would have saved
      a nasty bit of trouble for myself, perhaps, if I had remained and argued.
      And my trouble later that day&mdash;and that monkey with the missing tail&mdash;was
      the seed from which&mdash;But that&rsquo;s getting ahead of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      ===There were really three messes aboard the <i>Zizania</i>. There was the
      captain&rsquo;s mess aft, with special dishes, which was entirely distinct from
      the crew&rsquo;s food. On the port side was set out the food for the black half
      of the checker-board crew, and on the starboard side the white half
      received their provender.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were at dinner in the captain&rsquo;s mess. It was our first meal at sea&mdash;our
      first meeting at table.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Miss Kama came in we were just sitting down. The captain was with us,
      having left one of the Joneses at the wheel. Keedy lifted his paint-streak
      mustache against his nose in a smile, and pulled out a chair beside his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit here, my dear,&rdquo; he said to the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked past the chair, came around to my side of the table, and sat
      down. She did not toss her chin or sniff, as some girls would have done,
      to show dislike of Keedy. She was a cool proposition, that girl was.
    </p>
    <p>
      That left the chair beside Keedy the only vacant one at the table. A plump
      little man had been standing off at one side, waiting for the last choice
      of seats. He looked rather bashful, and his round face was shining with
      soap, and his hair was plastered down at the sides and combed up in front
      in a fancy cowlick. You could see that he realized that he did not exactly
      belong at that table. Therefore he had scrubbed himself up for the
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Rask Holstrom did not trouble himself with any of the finer graces
      of society. He gruffly introduced the little man as Romeo Shank, chief
      engineer, and told Shank to slide into the chair beside Keedy. &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t
      drawing any fine lines between ship&rsquo;s officers on this trip,&rdquo; stated the
      captain, bluntly, for the benefit of all concerned. &ldquo;Get to table while
      the grub is hot, and get it into you&mdash;that&rsquo;s the motto. Business
      before style is the idea aboard this boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to shovel food industriously with his knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keedy hitched away from his table-mate a few inches, and looked across at
      me, and deepened the wrinkle between his eyes. But he could not spoil my
      appetite. Something else which happened the next moment pretty nigh did
      it, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      A black man leaped into the saloon through the forward door by which the
      waiter came and went. Two other black men were at his back. They stopped
      just inside the door and dragged off their knitted caps. They had the
      appearance of being a delegation, and an excited delegation at that. It
      was plain to be seen that they had come rushing aft without stopping to
      figure on consequences. The leader carried something in front of him, and
      it was looped over the blade of a wicked-looking-knife. He held the object
      at arm&rsquo;s length toward Captain Holstrom, pointed at it with the vibrating
      finger of his left hand, and yelped shrilly like a dog. He was too excited
      and too furious to put his complaint into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have ye got there&mdash;a snake?&rdquo; yelped the captain, gulping down a
      mouthful, and wrinkling his nose like one who had suddenly come upon
      something disgusting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We find him in our kittle&mdash;we find him dere. Yassuh! We eat &rsquo;most
      to de bottom, and den we find him,&rdquo; raved the negro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom snapped up from the table and strode over and squinted at
      the object which dangled from the knife blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dey cook for us in our kittle a monkey tail&mdash;dem white men cook dat
      for us, and laugh,&rdquo; squealed the negro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think that some of those cheap white jokers put it in, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dey laugh all de time since when we pull him out. Yassuh, it&rsquo;s a lot of
      fun for dem men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom rubbed his nose thoughtfully, and stared down on the
      thing which had savored the black men&rsquo;s dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A happy thought seemed to strike him. He turned his head and winked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that thing out and whack it across the face of the white man you
      find laughing the hardest,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;When he gets up to hit you
      pitch in.&rdquo; He came lurching back to the table. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t intend to have
      the row till to-morrow,&rdquo; he informed us, in an undertone. &ldquo;But this is too
      good a chance to miss. We&rsquo;ll get that checker-board crew on a war basis
      where they&rsquo;ll stay put.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The black men were lingering at the door, trying to get the captain&rsquo;s
      meaning through their wool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Captain Holstrom,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I think I know how this thing
      happened&mdash;and I feel it&rsquo;s too bad to have innocent men beaten up.&rdquo; I
      started to tell what I had seen, but he swore and broke in on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t butt into something that&rsquo;s none of your business!&rdquo; he snapped. He
      roared at the men: &ldquo;Go do what I told you to do. Go punch the jokes out of
      that white gang or you&rsquo;ll have no peace the rest of the voyage. Get out of
      here before I kick you out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It sounded like a very pretty row, judging it from where we were sitting
      in the saloon. It began in a very few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Number-two Jones,&rdquo; directed the captain, &ldquo;go out there and oversee,
      and let me know when it&rsquo;s time to break the clinch.&rdquo; He loaded up his
      plate once more and kept on eating.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about five minutes the mate returned. &ldquo;I reckon it&rsquo;s about time to
      knock &rsquo;em apart, Captain Holstrom,&rdquo; he advised, shoving his head in
      at the door. &ldquo;No great harm done, but they&rsquo;re chewing each other bad, and
      that means expense for plaster and salve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If I hadn&rsquo;t already lost my appetite for dinner, that grisly statement
      from Mr. Number-two Jones would have fixed me. I pushed back from the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, Sidney,&rdquo; commanded the captain, kicking his chair out from
      under him. &ldquo;Come settle your dinner. I&rsquo;ll find a club for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll obey the orders you gave me first, sir,&rdquo; I called after him; &ldquo;I
      won&rsquo;t butt into something that&rsquo;s none of my business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say&mdash;&rdquo; He had stopped and whirled on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sore because he had snapped me up so short before them all. I
      thought my explanation should have been considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to say that this fight was needless. You started it; now you can
      stop it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keedy had been lighting a cigar, and it was plain that he did not
      intend to venture out into the mêlée.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here&mdash;I tell you to come along,&rdquo; yelled the captain. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your
      duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on your life. I&rsquo;m no ship&rsquo;s officer! I&rsquo;m along as a diver, not as a
      prize-fighter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom looked ugly enough just then to tackle me as a preface to
      his job forward, but after cursing a moment he followed the mate. The riot
      was increasing, and it was plain that he was needed in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keedy leaned back and scowled at me through his cigar smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I had picked a quitter,&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re tackling a job
      that needs sand. You ain&rsquo;t a tin horn, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t answer and the back of my neck began to itch; I suppose if I had
      had hair there like a dog&rsquo;s, the hair would have bristled. That itching in
      the neck when you&rsquo;re mad is a survival of the old days when men had lots
      of hair on &rsquo;em.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started to walk out of the saloon. Miss Kama was sitting there, looking
      at us, and her presence rather complicated matters for a man who was
      getting madder all the time, as I was. The other officers had chased along
      on the trail of Captain Holstrom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A second-hand diving-suit doesn&rsquo;t stack up very high against what we&rsquo;re
      putting into this thing&mdash;Captain Holstrom and myself,&rdquo; he insisted.
      &ldquo;There was something going in from your side in addition to the
      divingsuit, as I understand it. But a coward can&rsquo;t invest grit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stopped at the door and walked back toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A what?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said &lsquo;a coward.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I slapped him&mdash;not hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now come up on deck with me, Mr. Keedy. You&rsquo;ve got to come after that.
      There&rsquo;s a lady here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me.&rdquo; She looked at
      Keedy and set her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Keedy jumped up and pulled a gun instead of putting up his fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fight that way, Mr. Keedy,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;I have no gun. You&rsquo;d
      better put yours up. You can&rsquo;t afford to kill me&mdash;not yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the devil of it,&rdquo; he blurted, after waiting a moment.
      &ldquo;You have taken advantage of&mdash;of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of your hankering to get money into your paws,&rdquo; I snapped back at him.
      &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t come up and fight man fashion, I can&rsquo;t make you, but if you
      ever call me a coward again on this trip I&rsquo;ll put in a little evidence to
      the contrary with these.&rdquo; I showed him my fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rammed his revolver into his hip pocket and stamped out of the saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the girl looking at me, wrinkling her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Miss Holstrom,&rdquo; I apologized. &ldquo;But an itching to
      strike that man has been in my fingers for some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have waited until you had an excuse to strike harder than
      that, Mr. Sidney. I have known Marcena Keedy for a long time. A man like
      you with a big job ahead ought to be able to keep his eyes to the front
      all the time. Now you will have to keep looking behind you. I say&mdash;I
      have known Mr. Keedy for a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed a few minutes afterward, and I went with my head down, and I
      was pretty thoughtful. Captain Holstrom and I bumped together in the
      doorway. He shoved past me and threw a club into a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you can dive better&rsquo;n you can fight,&rdquo; he snorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he bawled to the waiter and demanded his piece of pie.

    <h2>
      XXIX&mdash;THE TELLTALE RIBS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE was nothing
      especially interesting about that prolonged grunt of the old <i>Zizania</i>
      down the California coast. She rolled and thrashed, and the brisk trades
      spattered spray over her bows, and she certainly took her own time in
      moving along.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all settled down to endure the trip as best we could, but it was a
      rather surly party. Forward, the blacks and whites nursed their scars and
      their grudge; aft, Keedy and I scowled at each other so much that nobody
      could be happy around where we were. Miss Kama walked the deck alone, or
      read, or embroidered in her state-room; once in a while I got a glimpse of
      her through the door while she was at work. She continued to sit beside me
      at table, but she was very cool and distant. I don&rsquo;t know as I tried to
      have her anything else. I would have liked to lean over the rail and talk
      with her, though I never presumed to speak to her on deck. Take a fellow
      when he is young, penned aboard a slow packet, a pretty girl near him all
      the time, and you bet he cannot confine all his thought to the scenery and
      his job.
    </p>
    <p>
      She truly was a pretty girl! I can see her now as she strode to and fro on
      the upper deck, her hands shoved deep in the pockets of her white sweater,
      and drawing it forward so that it set off her plumpness. There was a sort
      of indescribable tousle to her hair, if I may put it that way. I don&rsquo;t
      know what the color was&mdash;there&rsquo;s no name for those shades of copper
      and brown and all that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know I liked mighty well to see the sun shine through that hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      I loafed below and forward considerably. I found a lot to interest me,
      particularly a job that the Russian Finn was on in his spare time. He was
      making a new tail for his monkey. He explained to me half tearfully that
      the monkey would never be safe or happy otherwise. I had pretty hard work
      to understand the man&rsquo;s broken lingo, but I gathered that this especial
      kind of monkey needed to spend a portion of his time hanging head downward
      from his tail in order to be well and contented. Once or twice since the
      tail had been amputated the monkey had run up the foremast or the derrick,
      and had confidently tried to throw an imaginary tail over a rope, and had
      tumbled to the deck, where he had squatted and moaned and examined the
      stump with confused and pitiful attempt to understand the phenomenon. I
      could sympathize with the Finn&rsquo;s fears when he said that &ldquo;some day he fall
      over the board or break him damn neck.&rdquo; The cook&rsquo;s random blow had left
      some inches of the stump, and to this with marline and glue the Finn
      deftly fastened by an &ldquo;end-seizing&rdquo; a wire covered with furred skin. I
      wondered where he secured this skin. He owned up to me. He had captured
      and killed one of the cook&rsquo;s pet cats, and the cook had never opened his
      eyes wide enough to detect the crime, or to behold where the skin of the
      defunct was performing vicarious atonement.
    </p>
    <p>
      This catskin-covered wire was hooked at the end. Edison, I reckon, never
      watched the testing of an invention with greater raptness than the Finn
      displayed as the monkey, after a thorough inspection of the new appendage,
      clambered aloft to where a rope swayed invitingly. I confess that I shared
      in that interest. It proved a surprising success. The monkey swung from
      the hook, chattered, and grinned, and came down and sat for long minutes
      scrutinizing the thing, running busy little fingers along the furred wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may need an inventor with brains when I get at my job down below here,&rdquo;
       I told the Finn. &ldquo;I will remember what you have done to your monkey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when the time did come, it was the monkey instead of the master who
      served.
    </p>
    <p>
      As day followed day, and we finally raised the loom of the southern
      California mountains in the blue distance on our port, Ingot Ike came out
      of the lethargy in which limitless supplies of soft gingerbread seemed to
      involve him. He talked to me with the brown crumbs sticking in the comers
      of his mouth, and his spirits rose higher each day. He was like a
      thermometer which was being brought nearer and nearer to heat. His talk
      became more eager, his demeanor more alert, joy more intense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all I&rsquo;ve talked about it, and told &rsquo;em about it, and argued,
      it&rsquo;s coming true at last,&rdquo; he kept repeating to me. He had fastened
      himself to me with especial insistence during the voyage. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one
      who is going to get it, who is going off this boat right down to where it
      is, where you can lay your hands right on it, sir. Won&rsquo;t it be a grand
      feeling when you lay your hands on the first box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I admitted, &ldquo;it will&mdash;when I lay my hands on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not say that with any great enthusiasm. If Ingot Ike had not been so
      full of gingerbread and glee he would have seen that I was pretty much
      down. That San Francisco cocktail had got well worked out of me. I&rsquo;d had
      plenty of time to think the whole thing over during that wallow down the
      coast. A man could be hopeful, in on shore, with Mr. Keedy rolling the
      word &ldquo;gold&rdquo; over his tongue like a luscious morsel. I had been hopeful&mdash;and
      desperate. But after days at sea in that rickety old tub, with her rotten
      equipment, her bargain-sale fittings, her makeshift crew, with her whole
      grouchy, suspicious, and reckless atmosphere, I decided that I was a fool
      and would have been better off if I had gone out and hunted for a
      legitimate job. I had ahead of me the fact, according to old Ike, that
      other good men had tried and failed. I had behind me just then the sure
      feeling that Mr. Keedy proposed to do me up as soon as I made good,
      provided I did so by some lucky chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last stage of the voyage south was made with old Ike posted in the
      crow&rsquo;s-nest, his beak thrust out, and his mat of hair fluttering in the
      wind. He was so excited that he forgot to wallop gingerbread between his
      toothless jaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Number-two Jones, who wasn&rsquo;t a bad sort, gave me some information about
      the coast which was in sight of us since we had crossed the mouth of the
      Gulf of California. He had sailed those waters before. He had a somewhat
      misty remembrance of where the steamer <i>Golden Gate</i> had gone ashore,
      but he had never been in the vicinity of the spot, for the sand-bars
      obliged craft to keep well offshore.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to his recollection, the wreck had occurred along the Guerrero
      coast, somewhere between Orilla and Acapulco. The doomed steamer, after
      she had caught fire, was headed for the harbor of Acapulco, almost the
      only haven on the coast, but an outlying sand-bar tripped her many miles
      north of her destination and she went to her grave. Mr. Jones confessed
      that he did not know just where; he would be obliged to hunt fifty miles
      of coast for her if it were up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ingot Ike had the memory of a monomaniac on the subject of the <i>Golden
      Gate</i>. He peered under his palm at the hazy sky-line; he threw back his
      head and snuffed into the east like a dog treeing game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom started the lead going as soon as Ike had asked to have
      the <i>Zizania</i> hug the coast more closely. He knew the reputation of
      those hummocks and submarine plateaus of sand, and the howl of the
      leadsman rather astonished me when he reported, for on the Atlantic coast,
      to which I had been accustomed, we would be in deep water with a
      coast-line so far away in the hazy blue of the east. At a distance which I
      judged to be at least two miles offshore we were getting a report of only
      fifteen or twenty fathoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Ike began to swish his thin arm. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;d better down killick,
      Captain!&rdquo; he screamed from the crow&rsquo;s-nest. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re laying off of her. This
      is the place.&rdquo; He scrambled down and ran to the wheel-house. &ldquo;If you put
      her in closer than this she&rsquo;ll roll her blamed old smokestack out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom accepted that advice promptly, though the shore-line was
      at least a mile away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He yelled shrilly, and splash! went the port anchor. When she had swung
      wide he sent down the starboard mud-hook, and she headed the rolling
      Pacific, riding easily to the heave of the giant sweepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little thrill tingled in me as she came to a halt. We were on the ground
      at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now up to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      There were plenty of other men on that boat, but there was only one man
      who could reach out and put his hand on that treasure, and that was
      myself. The thought did not help to cheer my despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom was immediately busy with a huge telescope which he
      lifted from its rack and leveled across the sill of the wheel-house
      window. Old Ike was excitedly counseling him, jabbing a digit toward the
      shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow down from that second nick in that hossback mount&rsquo;in,&rdquo; the guide
      suggested. &ldquo;Them is my bearings. You ought to see them ribs fairly plain
      against the white where that surf is breaking inshore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence after that while the captain squinted through the glass,
      twisting a section now and then to sharpen the focus. His daughter was in
      the wheel-house at his side, her face tense. She had never intimated to
      me, of course, what her ideas were in regard to this treasure quest. She
      may have held the whole project in the same contempt in which she seemed
      to hold Keedy, its chief instigator, or old Ike, its prophet. But I stole
      a look at her, and decided that she was interested now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, anything with intellect above that of a steer would have had to be
      interested at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were hoping that yonder under those rollers lay three or four million
      dollars&rsquo; worth of gold&mdash;gold enough to buy everything that man or
      woman could desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the blockheads of the checker-board crew, who could hope for no more
      than their wages from the quest, were staring over the rail from the main
      deck forward, their mouths open. Marcena Keedy was eating a cigar instead
      of smoking it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them ribs ought to be there, Captain,&rdquo; insisted the old man, wistfully.
      &ldquo;The rest has been buried, but them ribs have stood all the swash for
      years. They ought to be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Captain Holstrom straightened up. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re there!&rdquo; said he. He
      beckoned to me. I was at the rail. &ldquo;Come in here,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your
      next peek&mdash;for yonder is laid out your job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had good eyes and I spotted the objects right off. There were three
      curved ribs of a ship outlined against the white of the breaking rollers
      beyond. The telescope gave the view relief and perspective, and I saw that
      the ribs were well outshore. Many yards of tossing water, so I judged,
      were between them and land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you think?&rdquo; he inquired, when I passed the glass back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you after I&rsquo;ve been down, sir. A diver can&rsquo;t afford to waste
      guesswork on the top side of water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl shook her head when her father offered her the telescope, and
      Keedy came in and took his look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away in there, is it? Well, what are we waiting for out here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom looked his partner up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sudden exhibition of a lack of a practical knowledge took his breath
      away for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re waiting out here because we have got to stay here, Marcena. This is
      as far as it&rsquo;s safe to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might as well sit on the Cliff House piazza and boss the job as be out
      here,&rdquo; grumbled the gambler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what sort of an idea you had about getting this treasure,&rdquo;
       retorted the captain. &ldquo;But if you had paid attention to Ike when, he was
      telling about the lay of the land you ought to have realized that we
      wasn&rsquo;t going to tie up to that wreck and have Sidney hook bags of gold on
      to a fish-line for you to pull up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m down here to have a general oversight in this business,&rdquo; said Keedy,
      &ldquo;and I propose to be near enough to the job to oversee it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom looked a bit disgusted. &ldquo;We might rig a bos&rsquo;n&rsquo;s chair for
      you on one of them ribs, and cut a hole in the water for you to look down
      through. But see here, Marcena, don&rsquo;t get foolish about this thing. All
      you&rsquo;ve been thinking about, so I judge, is of them boxes of gold, and you
      haven&rsquo;t stopped to figure on the way of getting &rsquo;em. I have
      figured. I&rsquo;ve talked a lot with old Ike when you wasn&rsquo;t listening, but was
      dreaming about them ingots. Now you listen to me. Let&rsquo;s start in without a
      row and a general misunderstanding.&rdquo; He began to dot off his points with a
      stubby forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t anchor the <i>Zizania</i> any nearer. There isn&rsquo;t holding-ground
      on that sand, and we&rsquo;ve got to have plenty of water under this steamer in
      case of a blow. See those lighters forward? I bought &rsquo;em after I
      got a general understanding of the lay of the land here from Ike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bought a lot of things without consulting me,&rdquo; said Keedy, showing
      his grouch. &ldquo;What <i>am</i> I in this thing&mdash;a passenger or a
      partner? Seeing that my money is in it, I propose to have my brains in,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man acted and talked in a way to indicate that he was starting out
      hunting for trouble. It began to look to me as if there were worse shoals
      ahead for our partnership than the shoals of San Apusa Bar. Mr. Jones had
      given me that as the name of the place where the wreck lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. Rask Holstrom did not have the steadiest temper in the world. His
      eyes narrowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every man for his own line, Keedy. I&rsquo;m not presuming to tell you how to
      deal from the box, nor how to size the buried card in stud poker. Nor I
      don&rsquo;t need any advice from you when it comes to handling a job of work in
      tidewater. I&rsquo;ve waited till I got here to tell you my plans. When I can
      talk and you can see the layout at the same time, I&rsquo;ll not be wasting so
      much breath; even those faro-game brains of yours can take in what I&rsquo;m
      getting at. Now, hold right on! This is going to be a square deal, and you
      can sit close to the jack-pot. Those four lighters are going overboard,
      and we&rsquo;ll moor them in a chain between here and the shore. We can splice
      the cables so as to allow a hundred fathoms between each one. That will
      make each lighter a sort of a bridle anchor for the others, and we ought
      to get the inshore lighter mighty nigh the wreck. You can stay on that
      lighter and have your meals brought if you hanker to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He snapped out that last remark while he was backing down the ladder from
      the bridge to the main deck. The sneer that went with it did not improve
      the state of Keedy&rsquo;s feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show this aggregation whether I can boss a job or not,&rdquo; he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided right then that if Keedy tried to boss me from that inshore
      lighter the partnership of Holstrom, Keedy &amp; Sidney would get a
      fracture in the second joint much wider than the one which was already
      widening there. I looked after him when he strolled away, and I reckon if
      he had turned around and given me one of those nasty looks of his just
      then I would have run after him and hoisted him a good one under the
      coat-tail&mdash;gladly taking the consequences. I had never hated Anson C.
      Doughty any worse. Keedy had grafted himself on to the project with stolen
      money&mdash;and now he was insulting the rest of us by placing us in the
      rogue class with himself and in need of watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose I looked very blue and ugly and disgusted as I stood there at
      the rail, scowling first at Keedy and then at the streaming white of the
      surf which played beyond the ribs of the wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl spoke to me. She leaned from the window of the wheel-house, and
      there was a note in her voice I had never heard before. All her
      brusqueness was gone. She was sort of confidential and wistful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think much of this scheme, do you, Mr. Sidney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was in the mood to agree with her. &ldquo;There must be an almighty good
      reason why those other fellows did not recover the treasure, Miss
      Holstrom, providing old Ike is right in what he says and that they didn&rsquo;t
      get it. I can tell better after I have been down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen a diver at work. It is very dangerous, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on the job. I have been as deep as one hundred and seventy
      feet, Miss Holstrom, and I felt perfectly safe, though the pressure made
      my nose bleed. Another time I was down in only four fathoms in the wash of
      a lee shore, and they couldn&rsquo;t keep my lines and my air-hose dear, and
      they pulled me up near dead. That&rsquo;s a lee shore yonder, and I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m
      going to find some very good reasons why the other divers didn&rsquo;t succeed.
      Sometimes I am tempted to believe that they did get the gold and that old
      Ike&rsquo;s talk is simply a dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the whole affair is a nightmare&mdash;I mean this trip,&rdquo; she
      declared. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe the good Lord is going to allow a man like
      Marcena Keedy to succeed in any decent enterprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rubbed my ear and looked at her for a few minutes. I had been turning
      over a thought about this expedition in my mind for some days. I did not
      know whether to say anything to her about it or not. It would be giving
      Captain Holstrom a pretty hard dig. But I blurted it, for she knew I had
      something on my mind and bluntly demanded to know what I was thinking
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps this is the kind of a scheme where the devil will help his own,
      Miss Holstrom&mdash;and therefore Keedy belongs in the thick of it as
      chief manager. He&rsquo;ll win on that basis. I don&rsquo;t know much about admiralty
      law or maritime justice. But it may be that this treasure has not been
      officially abandoned. Perhaps taking it is stealing it. I know that the <i>Zizania</i>
      got away from port with papers as a trawl fisher. I know I have no
      business talking like this about your father&rsquo;s affair. But if it&rsquo;s to be
      real stealing, perhaps we&rsquo;ll succeed with Keedy in the game,&rdquo; I said&mdash;and
      it was a pretty clumsy joke. It fell flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope my father will wake up,&rdquo; she said, curtly, looking down on him
      where he was giving off orders about clearing the big derrick. &ldquo;Sometimes
      I almost believe in evil spirits and in control of a man&rsquo;s mind by another
      man&mdash;in a wicked way, I mean. But I thank God there&rsquo;s one of the
      Holstrom family who can&rsquo;t be hypnotized by Marcena Keedy. That is why I
      have come on this voyage&mdash;my father needs a guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came down the steps from the wheel-house, and went into her
      state-room. I walked aft, for the <i>Zizania</i> had swung with the
      surges, and was tailing toward shore, and I wanted to look at the place
      where my work had been cut out for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keedy met me amidship. He came out from behind a lashed life-boat, and it
      struck me at once that he had been in ambush, spying on me. That was
      before he had opened his mouth. He did not leave me in any doubt when he
      began to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to an understanding about Miss Holstrom, Sidney,&rdquo; he rasped,
      leveling his finger at me. &ldquo;You let her alone. No more buzzing her behind
      my back or her father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keedy, you have started running after trouble to-day. In my case, you&rsquo;ll
      catch up with it mighty soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s make believe I have caught up. I&rsquo;m going to marry that young
      lady. And no cheap Yankee masher is going to stand around and make sheep&rsquo;s
      eyes at her. That&rsquo;s business and you keep your hands down. You slap me
      again, Sidney, and I&rsquo;ll drop you in your tracks&mdash;even if the gold
      stays there till we can get another diver.&rdquo; He had his hand on his hip,
      and his eyes were fairly green.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started to tell him what I thought of him and his chances with that
      girl, proposing to throw in a few remarks about what I should do if I
      wanted to. But I shut my mouth suddenly. I had no right to stand out there
      and insult a girl by quarreling about her with a fellow of that stripe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vastly different were the circumstances and the relations of the persons
      concerned&mdash;but I felt the same rankling of resentment which hurt my
      pride and my feelings when Jeff Dawlin growled his warning in my ear. I
      hated to leave any false impressions with Keedy. I did not propose to have
      him think I envied him anything he possessed or thought he possessed.
      Pride and the spirit of brag&mdash;that was it&mdash;prompted my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; I shot out at him, &ldquo;I have a girl East who is worth more than
      all the gold you expect to find in that wreck over there. What do you
      think I&rsquo;m out in this God-forsaken country for? What do you think I&rsquo;m
      gambling along with you for? It&rsquo;s so I can grab off enough money to make a
      showing when I carry it back home and pour it into her lap! Don&rsquo;t you
      worry, Keedy. I don&rsquo;t want any of your girls. There&rsquo;s one who is waiting
      for me back East!&rdquo; How a man will lie when he gets to talking about girls!
      I snapped my fingers under Keedy&rsquo;s nose and walked on aft. I felt
      considerably relieved because I figured I had taken some of the conceit
      out of him. I had a lot taken out of myself when I returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Kama Holstrom met me. She gave me one of those up-and-down glances
      which seem to sting like the flick of a long lash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no objection to your discussing your love affairs with Mr. Keedy,
      my dear sir&mdash;though I question your good taste. But I must ask you
      not to discuss me with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you I did not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stepped into my state-room only to get my cap. I was walking on the
      other side of the life-boat when you were talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you understand my request, sir.&rdquo; She walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fine partnership&mdash;that of Holstrom, Keedy, and Sidney,
      treasure-seekers! And there was a silent partner whose silence just then,
      along with her disgust, sent a crimson flame into my cheeks.

    <h2>
      XXX&mdash;THE LOCKS OF THE SAND
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>IGHT away I found
      that Captain Holstrom knew how to &ldquo;team&rdquo; a crew. He started that
      checkerboard outfit of his to humping in good earnest after he and I had
      planned out the details of setting the stage for the work ahead of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We needed to reach as long an arm as possible toward the wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside of four days after we planted our mud-hooks on San Apusa Bar, we
      had our string of lighters in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      First we anchored them and then we linked them with one another by cables
      because the sandy bottom inshore from the steamer afforded poor
      holding-ground for the anchors. Having a number of lighters hitched
      together in this manner, the chain made a sort of spring cable for the
      lighter nearest the wreck where the scuffling surges were piling high over
      the shoals. The scow nearest the shore thrashed about in rather lively
      style, but I figured that I could do my work from it in pretty fair
      fashion. At any rate, by our system of cables, we planted the lighter less
      than three hundred feet from the upstanding ribs of the Golden Gate. It
      was about the best we could do, considering our limited equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fifth day all was ready for me to go down for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I had been allowed to pick my own helpers, and I had been giving
      them lessons for some time. I chose Mate Number-two Jones to tend hose and
      lines, and Chief-Engineer Shank was to manage the air-pump.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had found them to be steady and reliable men. I owned a Heinke
      diving-dress which had cost me six hundred dollars, and with the right men
      &ldquo;up-stairs&rdquo; I was not worrying about my ability to get down and stay down&mdash;even
      if I had been off my job for a while. As to what I would be able to
      accomplish when I got down on ocean&rsquo;s floor I was not quite so sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I had been waiting for the lighters to be moored I had pumped Ingot
      Ike daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did seem to know what he was talking about&mdash;and I had to admit
      that. The matter of the treasure of the <i>Golden Gate</i> had crowded
      everything else out of his mind, and left his memory mighty dear. He drew
      a plan of her with a stubby pencil, and went into minute details of
      description. He said the ribs which showed were forward of the room where
      the treasure had been stored. The fire had been aft and amidship, and when
      she had struck the sand she had buried her nose, and these ribs were
      planted so solidly that the surf had not been able to beat them down. As a
      quartermaster who had known his ship, he was able to tell me how many
      paces aft from the standing ribs should be the spot where the treasure
      lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made ready the best life-boat on the <i>Zizania</i> for me and my
      equipment, a big yawl with sponsons. Captain Holstrom did not propose to
      take any chances with that outfit during the ferrying process. He went as
      coxswain, and I was not surprised, of course, to see Keedy scramble in
      even before I had lowered my diving-dress over the side. What did surprise
      me was to have Miss Kama show up as a passenger. When she stepped past me
      and went down the ladder my eyes bugged out. I thought &rsquo;twas
      somebody I had never seen before. She wore knickerbockers, and was
      gaitered to the knees, and she went into the life-boat as nimbly as a
      midshipman, asking a hand from no one. I could have cracked Keedy across
      the face with a relish for the way he rolled his eyes at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She showed the good sense of an out-of-door girl who understood a thing or
      two when she picked that costume. Embarking and disembarking with that
      surf running under a keel was no job for a girl in skirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we came up beside the in-lying lighter we were climbing white-flaked
      hills of water and coasting dizzily into green valleys. Those waves of the
      old Pacific which had marched across seas from the lee of the Society
      Islands were certainly making a great how-de-do in halting on those
      sand-bars of the Mexican coast; and inshore there in the shallows the surf
      had a nastier fling to it than off where we had found holding-ground for
      the old <i>Zizania</i>. It was a case of every one for himself in making
      the transfer from the life-boat to the lighter. I was ready to assist the
      girl, but she set foot on the gunwale, sprang with the heave of the boat,
      and landed on deck as lightly as a bird; she could not have done the trick
      more neatly if she had worn wings on the shoulders of that close-fitting
      sweater.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one cheerful moment for me on that day of anxiety; Keedy was the
      last passenger out of the lifeboat, and he teetered and made motions to
      jump, and flinched and squirmed and backed water like a swimmer afraid to
      plunge in. When he did jump at last he stubbed his toe on the deck of the
      lighter, and raked that hooked beak of his across the planks. I grinned at
      him when he staggered up, holding to his bleeding nose, and I went to
      overhauling my diving-dress, whistling a tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Number-two Jones and round little Romeo Shank to be helpful
      handy-Andys after the instructions I had given them. The girl never missed
      a motion they made in getting me ready. I felt a warm finger trying to
      worm its way under my rubber wristbands, and I turned to find her looking
      at me with a great deal of concern. She explained that she wanted to be
      sure that no water could leak in, and then she seemed to think that she
      had been just a bit forward, and she blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing I knew she was sturdily fetching one of my twenty-pound
      shoes, and stood there holding it ready for my helpers. I had gone down a
      good many times in my life, but I went that day with the happy
      consciousness of helpful interest in my poor self.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they set the helmet on to the breastplate and gave it its one-eighth
      turn into the screw bayonet joint, and set the thumb-screws. My front
      eyepiece was hinged like the window of a ship&rsquo;s port-hole, and this was
      open. The girl bent down and peered at my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems a terrible thing for you to be closed in there&mdash;for you to
      go down into that raging water,&rdquo; she said, her face close to mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish me good luck, and I&rsquo;ll go humming a tune,&rdquo; said I, smiling at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart I do,&rdquo; she answered, a catch in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shut the frame, and Mr. Shank set the turn-screw. With a man on each
      side of me, I scuffed my way to the ladder, and went over the rail of the
      lighter. I waited at the foot of the ladder&mdash;about ten feet under&mdash;until
      I felt that little pop in my ears which signals to the diver that his
      Eustachian tube is open, and that the pressure is equalized. Then I yanked
      the rope to ask for a taut lifeline, and let go my hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was bright and the bed of the sea was of sand, and I found good
      light below. There was a heavy sway to the water even on bottom, but I was
      strong, and knew how to handle myself. I found my footing, and started
      along.
    </p>
    <p>
      My only tool that day was a peaked-nose shovel. I crawled along, using it
      for a push-pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the bottom to be a succession of bars, which were parallel with
      the shore&mdash;waves of sand, so to speak, ranging from six to ten feet
      in height. It was a slow job working one&rsquo;s way across them. However, they
      assisted me&mdash;there was no danger of getting off one&rsquo;s course. I
      needed only to proceed at right angles to the bars. Through my bull&rsquo;s-eye
      in that dim green light I could see ahead for some distance. So at last I
      came to the timbers of the wreck. There was a long tangle of these, a
      great mass of wreckage hidden by the sea and protruding but a little way
      above the sand which the eternal surf had packed down. I kept along toward
      shore until I came to the timbers which, so my eyes told me, must be the
      ones that marked the location of the wreck. They went looming up through
      the water. I clung to one of them and rested. I was having no trouble with
      my air, and now that I had reached the scene of the work that fact
      comforted me. The movement of the sea in that shallower water was
      considerable, and now and then a heavier roller jostled me about. But I
      began to plan out a system of lashings that would anchor me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I got down on my belly, and started to measure paces along the edge
      of the timbers, following Ike&rsquo;s instructions as to distance. There was
      mighty little that was encouraging about the spot which I finally located
      as the probable site of the treasure-chamber. Sand was billowed and packed
      there, and the place was quite free from wreckage. It occurred to me that
      the other divers had dug the timbers away at this point. As I was feeling
      fairly fresh, I decided to use my shovel a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      After five minutes&rsquo; toil at that sand I began to perceive why the others
      had failed, providing Ingot Ike was correct and they <i>had</i> failed. In
      the first place, there was not the footing on that bottom that a submarine
      diver needs. I skated about almost helplessly when the heaving sea
      clutched at me. When I tried to drive the shovel into the sand I was
      pushed back, and the tool made only scratches on the bottom. Without a
      prop or a brace, a diver cannot pull or push horizontally with much force
      even under the best conditions, and when I did succeed in getting the
      shovel into the sand and scooped a hole, the particles began to settle
      back, driven by the swaying seas. The giant Pacific was jealous of the
      treasure it had engulfed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing more for me to do down there that day. I began to feel
      that pain above the eyes which warns the diver. I gave the signal for
      return, and went back at a lively pace, for the taut line helped.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw none of them on the lighter until my helmet had been removed, for
      when a diver ascends to the air his bull&rsquo;s-eye becomes covered with mist
      in spite of the wash of vinegar which has kept the glass clear below.
      Marcena Keedy was in front of me, looking at my hands, and acting as
      though he were wondering where I had stowed the find I had made below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s there, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what little I have been able to find out, I reckon it is there,&rdquo; I
      told him; &ldquo;and it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me much if it stayed there for some
      time.&rdquo; I was in no mood to encourage that polecat, who was plainly
      thinking more about that treasure than he was about any dangers I might
      have been through. He drew that streak-o&rsquo;-paint mustache up against his
      nose and looked like a dog about to snap. I turned away from him so as to
      have something better to look at. There was the girl beside me. She sure
      was an antidote for the poison of Marcena Keedy&rsquo;s evil eye. Her red lips
      were apart, and her little hands were clasped, finger interlaced with
      finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God you are back safe, Mr. Sidney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wasn&rsquo;t looking at me as though she were wondering in which pocket I
      had hidden an ingot of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not dangerous,&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;It was disappointing, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I ignored Keedy. I looked past him to Captain Hol-strom, and related what
      had happened below. It was a mighty interested crowd that stood around me
      and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea is,&rdquo; I wound up, &ldquo;this is no &lsquo;reach-down-and-pick-it-up&rsquo;
      proposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call doing damn little in an hour&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; growled Keedy.
      &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t down here to tell us how hard that job is. We have heard all
      about that from the other divers. You are down here to get that gold. You
      bragged around what a devil of a diver you have been, and now when we have
      to depend on you, all we get is some more conversation. Have you got us
      away down here and let us in on a dead one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that money was in a faro-bank instead of a sandbank,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;you
      would be just the man to get it out&mdash;you have had plenty of practice
      in that line. But this happens to be an honest job, and it needs something
      besides false cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I kept on talking to the captain:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After giving the thing a good looking-over I have begun to figure on a
      few plans. I&rsquo;ll paw over and size up the stuff on the <i>Zizania</i> this
      afternoon and see what there is in stock to help me.&rdquo; I told Mr. Jones to
      unstrap my shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Keedy saw them peeling off my dress he had a few more remarks to
      offer about the kind of a &ldquo;hot diver&rdquo; a man was who called an hour a day&rsquo;s
      work. If I had brought up an ingot in each hand from that first trip he
      wouldn&rsquo;t have been grateful; he would have wanted to know why I did not
      bring up the whole box.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a dirty job of it that afternoon pawing over the old junk on board
      that steamer, but I managed to sort out some material that fitted into my
      scheme, and it was ferried to the lighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went down again the next morning at sunrise, for the southwest
      trade-wind had quieted during the night, and the swell wasn&rsquo;t quite as
      energetic as it had been under the push of the breeze the previous day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the same spectators. Miss Kama, looking like a pretty boy in her
      knickerbockers, had plainly determined to keep in the front row, and I&rsquo;ll
      own up that her presence put ginger into my efforts. I reckoned I&rsquo;d show
      her the difference between a man who could do and dare and a sneering
      loafer of the caliber of Keedy. A handsome girl usually has an effect of
      that sort on a young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I reached bottom under the lighter they lowered an old mushroom
      anchor to me. I unhooked it, and started to roll it along the &ldquo;windrows&rdquo;
       of sand toward the wreck. It took every ounce of strength in me to boost
      it up those slopes. I had lashed a crowbar to the anchor stock, and when I
      finally got the thing to the wreck and had rested I stuck to the job,
      though I had really done as much as was advisable at one descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I loosened up a sizable patch of sand with the crowbar, and settled the
      anchor in the hole, stock upright. There was no need for me to pack the
      sand back; the Pacific Ocean would attend to that part of the job. The
      Pacific was altogether too busy in packing sand, though. It did not
      discriminate between an anchor which I wanted made solid and treasure
      which I wanted set free.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went down a second time that day. I carried small chains and a broad
      shovel. I lashed myself to the anchor&rsquo;s stock, and with that support as a
      fulcrum for my body I dug into the sand with the crowbar, and fanned out
      the loose particles with the broad shovel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was like the reverse of the story of the man who set out to carry
      water in a sieve. The sand kept running in. If I had been able to stay
      down there night and day, and have my meals brought to me, and could have
      worked without rest or sleep, I might have been able to dig a hole in that
      sand and to keep it dug out until I had come to that treasure. As it was,
      I toiled until my head seemed splitting, until blood ran from my nose, and
      I felt the first weakness of that peculiar paralysis of the limbs which
      divers experience when they pass the limit set for endurance under water.
      I lashed my tools to the anchor, and was pulled back to the lighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Human arms had given up&mdash;human strength and grit had failed. But I
      knew that through the hours of that afternoon, through the watches of the
      night, that old, miserly ocean would keep toiling on, rolling sand back
      into that hole, patting it down with unseen fingers, locking a door over
      the treasure that would serve the purpose better than doors of steel or
      bars of bronze. I should find all my labor undone when I came back to that
      anchor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore I did not lark and play when I was dragged over the rail of the
      old lighter. I stumbled to my seat, and sat and wiped blood from my face
      when the helmet had been twisted off the breastplate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four hours since you went down&mdash;you&rsquo;re sure a wonder!&rdquo; muttered
      Shank, patting my dripping shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was embarrassed&mdash;a bit shocked&mdash;when the girl hurried to me
      and began to wipe away the blood with her little handkerchief. I tried to
      push away her hands. It didn&rsquo;t seem right to have her do such a task. But
      she resisted me. She kept on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor boy!&rdquo; she said&mdash;or I thought she said it; I was not sure.
      There was pity in her tones&mdash;a caressing kind of pity, such as comes
      right from a woman&rsquo;s heart. I was astonished. She had been stiff and curt
      toward me&mdash;and was rather short with every one else, for that matter.
      She had never seemed tender even toward her own father.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she murmured again in my ear, leaning close to me, &ldquo;You poor boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;ll admit I was glad to hear her say it&mdash;I needed sympathy; but
      because I mention the girl and her little ways please do not jump at the
      conclusion that I was falling in love. She had overheard a declaration
      which established my standing with her and, I suppose, made her feel freer
      in my company. Oh no! I was not falling in love!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting there as I did with forty pounds of lead on my feet and eighty
      pounds of it across my shoulders, with air in my dress puffing me out like
      a giant frog, dripping with brine, and hideous with blood-smeared face, I
      wasn&rsquo;t much to look at in the way of a lover. And outside of the pity she
      had never by flicker of eyelid, or tone of voice, or touch of hand
      intimated that she was interested in me except as a young man who was
      tugging at a hard job and deserved a little encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all&mdash;all useless&mdash;down there&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s a glorious job, and I&rsquo;ve just begun on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s wicked for you to suffer like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was never so comfortable and happy in all my life&mdash;never so full
      of courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keedy was listening and I felt like tormenting him. He stuck his face down
      to mine. It was not a pretty face. His nose was swathed in absorbent
      cotton, which was held on with straps of court-plaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let me in on why you&rsquo;re so happy,&rdquo; he snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t happen to be any of your business,&rdquo; I informed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I a partner in this thing with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I get ready to tell you anything about my work, I&rsquo;ll see that you
      are informed. Or, if you want to make the trip, I&rsquo;ll tuck you under my arm
      and take you down to-morrow. I&rsquo;d be delighted to do so.&rdquo; He looked at me a
      little while and his eyes narrowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening I had a talk with Capt. Rask Holstrom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marcena Keedy was not in that conference. I walked the upper deck until
      Keedy had gone, grunting and growling, off into his state-room. Then I
      hunted up the captain where he was lying on the transom in the
      wheel-house, puffing at his pipe and looking rather sullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew what was ailing him. I had refused earlier in the evening to come
      into the wheel-house while Keedy was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being a plain and blunt man, I may as well say what&rsquo;s on my mind,&rdquo; stated
      Captain Holstrom, sourly. He did not arise. He squinted ar me from under
      the vizor of his cap, which was pulled low over his eyes. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t
      dealing with me and Keedy open and frank as your partners. You ain&rsquo;t
      giving us full particulars. You was down four hours to-day, and came up
      looking blue and scared, and then just talked flush-dush with my girl. We
      ain&rsquo;t down here for anything except straight business and results. Your
      two eyes are the eyes for all three of us. When you have used &rsquo;em
      down below there we&rsquo;re entitled to have full report. Me and Keedy ain&rsquo;t at
      all satisfied with the way this thing is running on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat and looked at him, and waited to hear whether he had any more to
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, we ain&rsquo;t satisfied,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Mr. Keedy isn&rsquo;t satisfied,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;I wish he would get so
      dissatisfied that he would quit this expedition. And I don&rsquo;t intend to
      kowtow to him and make him satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be damnationed!&rdquo; exploded the captain, pushing back his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be, Captain Holstrom. What I say doesn&rsquo;t have any reference
      to you at all. I hope my relations and yours will stay as they are&mdash;no,
      I hope they will improve as you know me better. But that gambler has
      grafted himself on to this scheme. He isn&rsquo;t a practical man, as you are.
      He sneers at me and my work&mdash;and God knows it&rsquo;s hard and dangerous
      work. He expects impossible things, and it doesn&rsquo;t do any good to come up
      out of that hell of water and explain to him. Every time he opens his
      mouth I feel like jumping down his throat and galloping his gizzard out of
      him. There! That&rsquo;s rough talk, but I mean it. If Marcena Keedy doesn&rsquo;t
      handle himself different where I&rsquo;m concerned there&rsquo;s going to be serious
      trouble aboard here. Hold on a moment! Hear me through. I respect your
      good judgment and I know you are willing to work hard. I&rsquo;m ready to talk
      to you at any time when that sneak isn&rsquo;t around. What you say to him after
      that about plans and expectations I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;that&rsquo;s your own
      business. But I&rsquo;m sorry you don&rsquo;t hate and distrust him as much as I do.
      Now I&rsquo;ll tell you what I found down there to-day, and how the thing looks
      to me.&rdquo; I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if all that is so, we may as well up killick and go home, eh?&rdquo; I
      never saw a more disgusted look on a man&rsquo;s face, or heard a more
      melancholy tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told you that to discourage you, or to crybaby myself. I&rsquo;m
      giving you the facts, and I hope you&rsquo;re practical man enough to keep from
      sneering about my efforts the way Keedy does. I&rsquo;m doing all that a human
      being can do&mdash;but you&rsquo;ve got to face facts, Captain Holstrom, and
      I&rsquo;ve been giving you facts, I say. That&rsquo;s the situation&mdash;that&rsquo;s all!
      You know as much as I know. If you have ideas, think &rsquo;em over and
      give &rsquo;em to me. I&rsquo;ll keep on trying to think up something myself.&rdquo;
       I went off to my state-room so as to give him time to do that thinking.

    <h2>
      XXXI&mdash;A TASTE OF BLOOD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE old Pacific was
      in her usual welter next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big seas were rolling up from the equator, and we could hear them
      booming in on the coast-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I look back on that nightmare off the bars of San Apusa I think the day
      when I went down with the anchor was the calmest day of our stay. With the
      everlasting thrust of the trades behind them the billows rolled, rolled,
      rolled, rolled&mdash;seethed and surged&mdash;giant green soldiers with
      the white plumes, charging that sandy shore. I got to feel after a time
      that they were soldiers in real earnest, and that they were after me&mdash;poor
      little midget, who was trying to accomplish the impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast Mr. Shank ventured to remark politely and somewhat nervously
      that he was supposing I would not try to go down that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I told Mr. Shank rather brusquely that of course I should go down, and
      added that if we were to wait for smooth water in soundings on the lee
      shore of the Pacific Ocean in the season of the trades, we should have
      brought plenty of knitting-work and novels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom, from the head of the table, smiled and winked at me with
      the most cordial expression I had ever seen on his face. I decided that
      one of my partners was regarding me in a more amiable frame of mind than
      he had before I had made that little speech to him. Mr. Keedy scowled at
      me, and I was glad of that mark of his continued disesteem. It occurred to
      me that perhaps I was weaning the captain from Keedy, for Holstrom snapped
      his friend up rather short two or three times during the meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went down that day with more weights. The tug of those rollers inshore
      was tremendous for a buoyant man, even in the comparative calm of the
      previous day. I realized what I would meet up with this day, and I was not
      disappointed in my reckoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was tumbled from hummock to hummock of the submarine sand-bars. I was
      knocked down and then was stood up once more. Sometimes I was lifted off
      my feet, and then I was rolled and pressed down and pinned to the sand
      till it seemed that I would never get on my feet again. Part of the time I
      was thrust ahead as if the Pacific were trying to make me walk Spanish&mdash;and
      then I was yanked backward on all-fours like a big crab.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew a whole lot about undertows, and I realized that I was having an
      experience with a particularly crazy one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men who have observed and studied think they have a pretty good line on
      the notions and the moods of the sea&mdash;but take it from me as a
      submarine diver, they haven&rsquo;t. If one is standing on a rock and looking
      out on it, or sailing across it in a safe boat, the ocean becomes a matter
      of &ldquo;beautiful surf,&rdquo; or an expanse more or less hubbly with waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      But get down into it&mdash;get down deep where it can play with you, twirl
      you, toss you, suck your breath, provided it can throttle your air-hose&mdash;where
      it can work all its schemes and its spite. You will find out that the
      ocean has a new trick for every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are beaches where persons have bathed in safety for years. Then all
      at once some day a shrieking man or woman is seized, as though by some
      hidden monster, and is dragged off to death. That mighty and erratic force
      is called an undertow. It is now here, now there. It is born out of
      diverted currents, checked tide rips. It sneaks up bays, seeking prey; it
      roams along open Peaches. I know a lot more about undertows, but that&rsquo;s
      all for now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in one that day off San Apusa. Wind, tide, a current wandering off
      its course&mdash;one of the currents that is uncharted and which is known
      only by some diver who meets it on its wanderings below the surface, had
      combined, and had come to play in the vicinity of the wreck of the old <i>Golden
      Gate</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I struggled on toward that wreck. Say, I met an old friend of mine. It was
      the mushroom anchor, and it was doing a sort of jig on top of a sand ridge
      when I first saw it. Evidently it had been lonesome during the night, and
      it had come to meet me. It was at least one hundred feet on the sea side
      of the wreck&mdash;and I had left it with fluke buried close to the ribs.
      If that undertow had dug up that anchor it might be doing other things.
      That thought came to me like a flash of hope. There&rsquo;s no telling what an
      undertow will do when it gets to prancing, you know!
    </p>
    <p>
      I unlashed the crowbar from the anchor stock and tumbled on over the
      ridges. I found myself in an opaque yellow light instead of in the green
      radiance I had found on my other two trips, and I knew that the sand was
      in motion inshore. When I came to the wreckage of the steamer I did not
      know my way about. The undertow had been dragging away the packing of sand
      here and there. More bulk of the débris was displayed, so far as I could
      judge by touch and by what I could see in the dim light. I groped my way
      along to the great ribs which showed above water, in order to get my
      bearing. It was a fight to get there. I was thrashed about and tossed and
      slatted. I wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure when I did get there, for other parts of&rsquo;
      the wreck had been uncovered so much that one could easily be deceived in
      water in which boiled so much sand that it was like working in soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I toiled back after I reckoned I had located the marker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the old Pacific had truly had a change of heart since the day before.
      The unseen fingers of that freakish undertow had been at work&mdash;they
      were still at work. They were scooping out sand instead of piling it in. I
      can best describe the appearance of things by saying that there was a
      smother of sand in the swirling water. Now and then the water cleared when
      the undertow let go its tuggings for a moment, and I could see parts of
      the steamer which formerly had been hidden from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had counted the paces that should bring me in the neighborhood of
      the treasure, I set my crowbar into the sand with all the strength I could
      muster, and twisted it around and around in order to loosen the stuff. It
      was wonderful how quickly the water dragged away what I set free from that
      pack.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bottle came bouncing up out of the hole. I dislodged pieces of broken
      crockery. Ingot Ike had said that the treasure had been stored in a
      compartment of the ship near the pantry. The sight of that jetsam
      encouraged me. I stabbed with all my might, drove the crowbar in again and
      again, struggled to hold myself on bottom, and muttered appeals to that
      undertow in my frenzy of toil. I do not know how long I worked. I do know
      that all my sensations informed me that I was remaining beyond my limit of
      endurance. But the conviction came to me that this was not a chance to be
      neglected. I was in a fever of hope. I wanted to show that coward of a
      Marcena Keedy that a strong man could call the bluff of a loafer&rsquo;s sneers.
      I wanted to convince Capt. Rask Holstrom that he had not picked out a
      piker, and perhaps I wanted a girl to give me the smile which success
      ought to win.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;and here&rsquo;s to the point!&mdash;all at once, when I was near
      fainting, my crowbar struck something which was not bottles or crockery. I
      managed at last to get the point of the bar under the object. I could not
      see what it was. I only knew, as I worked the bar, edging it around the
      thing to dislodge the sand, that the object was oblong and had corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      My buoyancy and the swing of the rolling sea would not allow me to pry
      with any great force. I could only pick at the sand and coax the box out.
      In the end I had it where I could get my fingers under the edges&mdash;and
      there&rsquo;s one thing a diver can do: he can lift with the strength of a
      giant, the air in his dress assisting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it <i>was</i> a box, so I found when I had it out. It was a heavy box
      even when lifted there under the sea. It was a small box, and there could
      be only one reason for such a small box being so heavy&mdash;it was one of
      the bullion boxes. Of that fact I was convinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      I carried several small chains at my belt&mdash;my lashings in case of
      need. I circled the box with chains, and secured it to my body as best I
      could, then clutched my arm about it for greater safety. As I worked I
      grew more excited&mdash;I had drawn first blood in my duel with the old
      Pacific. Excitedly I pulled the line to send my signal to the lighter,
      asking for help on the return. They told me afterward that I gave the
      emergency signal. Perhaps I did. They had been waiting for a signal for so
      long that they were in a state of panic. They feared that I had been
      drowned, for I had been down for horns. When they got my double tug, so
      they told me later, Number-two Jones gave a yell, called every man on the
      lighter to the rope, and proceeded to give me a run home in emergency
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first yank took me off my feet. Overballasted by the box of gold, I
      tipped head down, and butted the summit of the first hummock of sand with
      my helmet. My neck was snapped to one side and my head got a tremendous
      rap against the side of the helmet. I did not strike ground again until I
      reached the next ridge. I struck that and bounced, and I think I took a
      recess on breathing right then and there. I have not much recollection of
      the rest of that three hundred feet of rush back to the lighter. I know I
      hit a good many hummocks, and I must have passed away into dreamy
      unconsciousness when the drag upward through the water to the rail of the
      lighter began.
    </p>
    <p>
      They told me that when I came over the rail I was bent double, and it was
      some time before they saw that I had something tucked in my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard somebody shout, &ldquo;Oh, God, this man is dead!&rdquo; But I was just
      getting my wits back then. I opened my eyes. Two of the crew were holding
      me up, and Shank had my helmet off. He yelled like a maniac:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wrong! He ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty glad you&rsquo;re wrong, Shank,&rdquo; I told him. My voice was pretty
      feeble, but the memory of that box came back to me, and my thoughts were
      dancing even if I couldn&rsquo;t dance with my body just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to look around after that box, but I lost interest in it the next
      instant. It&rsquo;s pretty hard work for me to tell you what happened, and tell
      it in a matter-of-fact way, as I&rsquo;m trying to tell the rest of this yam.
      When I looked around I saw Kama Holstrom on her knees a little way from
      me, her face as pale as the white foam on the waves, her eyes wide open. I
      think her ears had been closed by horror when Shank had let out his first
      yell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re alive!&rdquo; she cried. And the next instant I was very much alive, for
      she leaped up and ran to me, and threw her arms around my neck and kissed
      me squarely on the mouth. Then her face was no longer white. It flamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to&mdash;I am sorry&mdash;it was a mistake!&rdquo; she gasped,
      and she broke out and cried like a baby. But I caught her hand before she
      could get out of reach of me, and pulled it to me and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if I <i>had</i> been dead you would have waked me up,&rdquo; I told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a blamed good mind to kiss you myself!&rdquo; roared old Holstrom from
      somewhere behind me. Then he let out a whoop and came and capered in front
      of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve brought up twenty thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of gold!&rdquo; he informed
      me. &ldquo;Five ingots, with the assay mark on &rsquo;em, and each worth four
      thousand dollars. That&rsquo;s the kind of a diver you are, Sidney! All
      together, men! Three cheers for the greatest sea diver that ever wore lead
      shoes!&rdquo; And the men gave the cheers while he pounded his fists on my back.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got a view of Marcena Keedy when I turned my head around. Mr. Keedy was
      not showing any interest in my condition&mdash;not he. He was sitting on
      deck with the open box hugged between his knees, and he was feeling over
      those bars of gold like a lover fondling his lady&rsquo;s cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m stuck on the style of that critter,&rdquo; mumbled Shank in my
      ear. &ldquo;He yanked that box away from you before we had fairly swung you
      inboard and before anybody knew you was alive. He pried it open, and has
      set there making love to it ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Ike was squatting in front of Keedy on his haunches, and was drooling
      like a hound watching a butcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s there! I&rsquo;ve always said it was there. It&rsquo;s there all bright and
      shining. They all have hooted at me because I have said it was there. Now
      what do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody has been a game sport in this thing except you and me,&rdquo; said
      Keedy, sticking an ingot up under Ike&rsquo;s nose. &ldquo;Nobody would back your hand
      till I came along. I&rsquo;ve had to talk everybody over before anybody would do
      anything. I know how to play a hand with a buried card in it. I&rsquo;ve played
      that hand to the limit, and now see what has happened. When you fellows
      are passing cheers around you&rsquo;d better hooray for the man who has turned
      the trick&mdash;for the man who kept at it till he got you down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave me a nasty side-glance and snuggled the box under his legs just as
      though he had recovered property which belonged to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where there&rsquo;s one there&rsquo;s the rest of &rsquo;em, eh, Sidney? You have
      found the nest of the beauties, eh? Well, do we get another nice little
      box to-day? We may as well open the game with forty thousand while we&rsquo;re
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shank was leaning close to me, unscrewing the wing nuts between the
      breastplate and my collar-band. He began to swear very soulfully in an
      undertone, and he kept on swearing when he got a look from me that
      indorsed all his sentiments in regard to Mr. Keedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are three millions down there&mdash;and twenty thousand is only a
      flea-bite,&rdquo; declared the callous knave. I don&rsquo;t believe he noticed that I
      was half dead when I was pulled up&mdash;or cared a rap about my
      condition, anyway. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m strong for bulling the game when it&rsquo;s coming your
      way. What do you say, Sidney, if we make the first day&rsquo;s ante forty
      thousand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Holstrom,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;a man who has been banging the soul out of
      himself for five hours in a divingsuit is in no condition to talk to a
      skunk like that over there. Can&rsquo;t you say something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I must confess that the captain did rise nobly to the occasion. A tugboat
      man who has spent most of his life fighting for berths in the maze of
      shipping along the San Francisco water-front needs considerable hot
      language in his business, and Captain Holstrom was in good practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve got the two partners against me now, have I?&rdquo; snarled Keedy. &ldquo;I
      had to fight to get the two of you into the proposition, and now that
      you&rsquo;re making good I&rsquo;ve got to fight both of you to keep the thing going,
      have I? Thanks for the hint as to how you propose to hold cards&mdash;but
      I serve notice right now that you can&rsquo;t whipsaw me between you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked as evil as a door-tender in Tophet, but his threats did not
      trouble me.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening something happened that indicated further cleavage of
      associations on board the <i>Zizania</i>, whose checker-board crew had set
      an example early in the cruise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ingot Ike came to the captain and myself in the wheel-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that we&rsquo;re beginning to haul in the bright and shining stuff that
      makes the world go round I&rsquo;d like to know where I&rsquo;m going to get off when
      the divvy comes,&rdquo; said he. And he was more than a little insolent in the
      way he said it. It was a good guess that he had absorbed more or less of
      the insolence of his new running-mate, Marcena Keedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom was pretty short with the man. He informed old Ike that
      when the work was done and we knew what the profits would be he would be
      handed a lay which would make him comfortable for life. &ldquo;That was the
      understanding between us when we started out on the gamble,&rdquo; said the
      captain. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got a dollar ahead now&mdash;you never did have. A
      lot of money wouldn&rsquo;t do you any good, anyway. You don&rsquo;t know how to keep
      it or how to spend it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t any of your business!&rdquo; declared Ike, with heat. &ldquo;We have begun
      to get up that gold. We&rsquo;ll get all of it. It&rsquo;s there, just as I said it
      was. I want ten per cent, of all that comes over the rail, and I want it
      without any strings on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you got it laid into your hand you&rsquo;d be around in six months
      borrowing from me,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;If this thing comes out as it ought
      to, I&rsquo;ll put enough in trust for you to pay you a hundred dollars a month
      as long as you live. Now go off and dream of that, and be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy your Aunt Lizy!&rdquo; yelped the old man. &ldquo;See here, me and Keedy is the
      whole thing in this, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom arose and grabbed Ike and tossed him out of the
      wheel-house door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them two fellows,&rdquo; he confided, wrathfully, to me, &ldquo;will be charging me
      board on this trip, besides taking all the profits for themselves, if I
      don&rsquo;t watch out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not confide to the captain any of my doubts that evening in our
      talk. I was hoping for the best. I had recovered one box with the
      assistance of my enemy, the old Pacific. I understood the queer and
      notional quirks of undertows. I realized that history might not repeat
      itself in this case&mdash;but the Pacific coast was new to me, and I was
      not ready to believe that I had happened on the only case of an undertow
      scooping sand instead of piling it and packing it. I went to bed, tired as
      a hound after a chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I went down into the sea again the next day, still hoping. Yes, I was
      fairly confident&mdash;so confident that I carried a pair of ice-tongs. My
      experience of the day before had shown me that this tool was just the
      thing with which to grapple one of those boxes and lift it from the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was plenty of motion in the depths of the sea. But I realized that
      it was not the motion of the day before. The swaying water thrust me ahead
      over the hummocks with more force than it pulled me backward. The water
      was clear and green once more. Where, oh, where had my undertow gone?
    </p>
    <p>
      I had ground my crowbar into the sand where I worked the day before. I
      could not find it, and after a survey I saw it had been covered by the
      drifting sand. Portions of the wreck which had been in sight were hidden
      again. The hole where I had wrought so valiantly was filled and smoothed.
      It is wonderful how quickly currents of water can make changes in sand. I
      had seen instances before in my submarine jobs; now I was beholding a more
      striking case. After inspecting the scene I judged that the treasure was
      buried more deeply than ever. The ocean had plenty of loose sand with
      which to work, and had used it. I tell you honestly I never suffered such
      an awful feeling of disappointment. The pang was worse because I had been
      successful once.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as though my enemy, the ocean, had decided to give me one bite of
      the fruit of success in order to whet the appetite of my expectations. It
      had not relented in order to do that&mdash;it had played a devilish trick
      on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had shown me that the millions were there&mdash;money-enough for all
      that life or love might require in this world. I had got a peep&mdash;had
      got one taste&mdash;and the malicious ocean had tucked it all out of reach
      once more, and was making faces at me with the wrinkles of that
      hard-packed sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was useless to remain down and exhaust myself. I signaled, and returned
      to the lighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as my bull&rsquo;s-eye cleared after I came up out of the bubbling water
      I saw Keedy. He was perched on the rail near the life-line coils, looking
      down at me like a fish-hawk eying its prey. For a moment I was glad I did
      not have another box. I enjoyed his disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after my helmet was off, I told Captain Hol-strom that a change in
      current had piled up the sand and that nothing could be done that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; raged Keedy, smacking his fist into his palm. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t
      take my advice yesterday. You wouldn&rsquo;t follow your hand when the cards
      were running right. I understand about those things. That was the time to
      double the ante! I know how to play the game for what it&rsquo;s worth. There
      ain&rsquo;t any brains in this whole outfit except what I&rsquo;ve got under my hat. I
      see it&rsquo;s up to me to go down there and show you how to do this thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be out of this diving-dress in a few minutes,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      welcome to use it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had a wild hope that he was mad enough to go down&mdash;angry enough and
      gold-hungry enough. It would have settled the case of Keedy if he had gone
      down&mdash;soaked with rum and tobacco as he was. But he swore and walked
      away and jumped into the life-boat&mdash;so much of a coward that he
      wanted to put as great a distance between that dress and himself as he
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can describe the happenings of the next two sad weeks in two words,
      &ldquo;Nothing doing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not that I didn&rsquo;t go down. I went every day. I tried all kinds of tools. I
      sat up nights to think, and worked days under water until they had to pull
      me back to the lighter, riding on my back over the sand hummocks, so weak
      that I could not use my feet and drag my lead-weighted shoes. But the old
      Pacific had given us our one mouthful of bait, and now was mocking us. If
      I loosened sand the ocean took that sand and piled it higher over the
      treasure. And all the time Keedy glowered and growled and swore, and said
      I was not half trying.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning Captain Holstrom came banging on my state-room door before I
      was awake. He tried to tell me something, fairly frothing at the mouth,
      but the words tumbled over each other so rapidly that I couldn&rsquo;t
      understand. He was jabbing a slip of paper at me, and I took it and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To Holstrom and Sidney,&mdash;With two partners working against me, I
      claim the partnership is broken. After this I&rsquo;ll work on my own hook, and
      I&rsquo;ll have a man who is a real diver, not a dub; and I warn you not to
      bother me in any way.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partnership broken!&rdquo; yelled the captain. &ldquo;And how do you suppose he has
      broken it? He sneaked away in the night. He took Ike and four of my crew
      and the best life-boat. But that ain&rsquo;t the worst. He took the gold&mdash;all
      of it! Took the twenty thousand. He had the key to the safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you let him have the key to the safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he howled around that he ought to have some office as a partner,
      and wanted to be treasurer. He has trimmed us for twenty thousand, and
      he&rsquo;ll use that money to fit out another expedition. He has done us good
      and proper, and there ain&rsquo;t anything sensible we can do about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I reflected a few moments, and decided that, considering the kind of a
      project we were working on, we could not afford to chase Keedy and howl.
      In the opinion of certain persons interested in that wreck, we might
      appear as thieves, ourselves, if the thing became known in Frisco.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to say something to Captain Holstrom about being well rid of
      Keedy, but I do not think he heard me. He was too busy stamping about and
      swearing. That was truly a dark-blue morning on the <i>Zizania</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were certainly weary and hopeless days which tagged on after that. I
      kept going down, for I hoped to meet up with another obliging undertow.
      But San Apusa Bar did not seem to be a popular resort for undertows.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about ten days we got another hard jolt. A little schooner came
      swashing up in the lee of the <i>Zizania</i>, and a boat was rowed off to
      us. The two men who leaped over the rail introduced themselves as Mexican
      customs officers for the district off which we lay, and they wore the
      uniform to prove their identity. It had been reported to them, they said,
      that we were seeking treasure from the wreck of the <i>Golden Gate</i>,
      and they told us we must stop such business at once and sail away or we
      should lay ourselves liable to arrest and imprisonment. They had a lot to
      tell us about what the law was, but I have forgotten. Maybe they were
      giving us straight law, and maybe they were not. Neither Holstrom nor I
      knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain did know men if he did not know law&mdash;and he was a man who
      had mighty keen sense for a crook&rsquo;s trail, having had a lot of experience
      with crooks on the water-front. He rubbed his red knob of a nose for some
      time, and listened. Then he invited the customs men into his sanctuary of
      the wheel-house, and called me along with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all about who has been talking this over with you, gents,&rdquo; he told
      them. &ldquo;I reckoned he would make down the coast in that life-boat he stole
      from me. He stole that boat, he stole my men, he stole what else he could
      lay his hands on here. He is a yaller-faced faro-dealer. He never told the
      truth, he never dealt square cards, he has always cut a corner on every
      man he had business with. I don&rsquo;t want to see you fooled. I&rsquo;m the captain
      of this steamer. You can see I&rsquo;m something of a man. This is my partner,
      and you can look at him and see that he is no crook. I&rsquo;m going to get
      right to the point, gents. Do you want to do business with a square man or
      a crook? You might as well be open with me. Men have to live down here in
      Mexico. I know all about this customs business along the coast. You&rsquo;ve got
      to do business to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They blinked hard, but they did not protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how much of a &lsquo;hot rock&rsquo; he dropped into your hat, but I&rsquo;m
      prepared to drop in a bigger and a hotter one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had never heard that expression about a &ldquo;hot rock&rdquo; before, and I was
      obliged to listen a little while longer in order to understand that
      Captain Holstrom was talking thus bluntly about a bribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In one case you&rsquo;re doing business with a crook&mdash;a thief. He&rsquo;ll turn
      around and do you when he has used you. In this case you are dealing with
      a man who has a name along the water-front, who owns this steamer, and who
      is here to make a dollar for himself and for you. You are men with brains
      and you can size up chaps pretty well. I&rsquo;ll bet you didn&rsquo;t like the looks
      of that whelp with his cat&rsquo;s eyes and his mustache cocked up&mdash;come,
      now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They blinked harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain leaned to me and whispered in my ear: &ldquo;Run and tell Kama to
      give you every gold piece she has got in her pocket. Dig over your own
      pockets. Tell the Joneses to dig. Bring it here. I&rsquo;ve got to keep &rsquo;em
      on the run with conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I returned with my collection, and the captain added the contents of his
      own pocket, banging the coins on the transom. Then he swept the money into
      a little sack and drove the sack down into the trousers pocket of one of
      the officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only posting a little forfeit that we&rsquo;ll do as we agree,&rdquo; cried
      Captain Holstrom, heartily. &ldquo;We are here where you can watch us, gents.
      But you can&rsquo;t watch a fly-by-night like that coyote who has been lying to
      you about us. Keep your eyes out&mdash;stand by us&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll get a
      &lsquo;hot rock&rsquo; in your hat that you&rsquo;ll need both hands to hold up. We&rsquo;ll see
      the other man&rsquo;s stake and then raise him out of the game&mdash;and if we
      don&rsquo;t, then come and seize the steamer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed the men to the rail, shook hands with them half a dozen times,
      and they returned most urbane grins when they rowed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they were out of ear-shot the captain cursed them in horrible
      fashion and shook his clenched fist at them under pretense of waving
      farewells.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what Keedy done as quick as he got down coast to a port, hey?
      Cleaned us out of what he could lug, and then sent them critters here to
      finish the job. He probably thinks he is going to make a clear field here
      for himself by strapping us for every cent, and then setting the customs
      on to us as soon as he can drop another &lsquo;hot rock&rsquo; into their hat so as to
      raise us out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t those men feel bound in any way after taking money from us?&rdquo; I
      asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They feel bound till the next fellow gets to &rsquo;em, my son. Do you
      see what we have got cut out for us? By the jumped-up Judy, we&rsquo;ve got to
      get that gold&mdash;and we&rsquo;ve got to keep ahead of everybody else in
      getting that gold, because them custom-house blood-suckers are going to
      stick to the juiciest crowd. I don&rsquo;t know what kind of an outfit Keedy
      proposes to bring back here, but he has got twenty thousand dollars in his
      fist, and a man can do a lot of business on charters with twenty thousand
      dollars. And we haven&rsquo;t got a sou markee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stamped into the wheel-house, shaking his fist above his head, and I
      walked up and down the upper deck, thinking some thoughts which I do not
      care to call back to mind.

    <h2>
      XXXII&mdash;PER MISTER MONKEY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>S she had done
      many times in those days of gloom and doubt, the girl came out of her
      state-room and walked with me. Her companionship was a consolation. She
      looked up at me from under her tousle of curls and swung along by my side
      with an easy air of comradeship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word &ldquo;comradeship&rdquo; best expresses our attitude toward each other.
      After that explosion of her feelings on board the lighter, when she had
      kissed me in front of the whole bunch, she had coated herself with just a
      little ice, and my Yankee reserve and sensitiveness detected it. It was as
      though she had hinted to me that I would be a cad to presume further
      because she had taken a woman&rsquo;s interest in my misfortune. In fact, she
      had dropped a few words in regard to women making fools of themselves when
      they are too frightened to know what they are doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, she stuck to that knickeroocker costume of hers, and I found
      myself forgetting half the time that she was a girl, for she clambered
      about over the truck aboard the old <i>Zizania</i> as no girl in skirts
      could, and never needed a hand on her trips to and from the lighter. She
      wore those clothes with such frank assurance that the garb was the only
      suitable one for the circumstances, with such lack of self-consciousness,
      that after a few days it really seemed as if the other men had forgotten
      that we had a girl aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps that accounts for the fact that when one of the firemen rushed
      past us a few minutes later he was using language such as he would not
      have used had he been properly mindful that there was a lady in hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fireman came from the depths below-decks, and was chasing the Russian
      Finn&rsquo;s monkey. He was so intent on the chase that when the fleeing monkey
      invaded the sanctity of the upper deck the fireman came along, too. There
      were several breathless instants in that part of the pursuit which we saw.
      You will recollect that this monkey had a false end to his mutilated tail&mdash;a
      curved wire, which was covered with cat&rsquo;s fur. As the monkey fled,
      screaming and swinging the heavy end of the tail from side to side, the
      hook caught, first on a stanchion, then on a lifeboat prop. The monkey had
      not entirely mastered the science of handling that new tail, or else he
      was too excited just then to remember its limitations. When he had his own
      pliant tail it didn&rsquo;t matter if a loop hooked around an obstruction. But
      now when the wire hooked itself the monkey was obliged to back up and
      unhook that inflexible loop. Each time he stopped he lost all the lead he
      had gained on the fireman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four times in traversing the upper deck the coal-heaver was near enough to
      make a crack at the monkey with a grate bar. Each time the monkey unhooked
      himself just in time to be able to dodge and continue the flight. Finally
      the fugitive made the ensign mast by a rousing leap, shinned, up, and hung
      over the dingy gilded ball at the top. I don&rsquo;t understand monkey talk, but
      I&rsquo;m sure that the yells he sent down were just as pure profanity as that
      which the fireman was howling up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, there, my man,&rdquo; I called, &ldquo;that kind of talk doesn&rsquo;t belong up
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shut up, gave the monkey a long and blistering stare, and came back
      toward the ladder. Sweat was running down through the soot on his face,
      and that face showed that he was in no pleasant frame of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asks to be excused,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but that&mdash;&rdquo; he gulped. &ldquo;Seeing that
      I can&rsquo;t talk about it before a lady and be polite, I asks to be excused
      again and I&rsquo;ll be going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I followed him to the head of the ladder and stopped him just as he was on
      the first rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re keeping up a little steam for the derrick windlass and the pumps,
      and that gimlet-eyed, snub-nosed hellion got into the bunkers when I was
      on deck, and turned on my wet-down hose, and shifted twenty tons of dust
      coal out to where it&rsquo;s all got to be shoveled back. I&rsquo;m going down to
      write out notices for a funeral and, by Jabez! I&rsquo;ll guarantee to have the
      corpse ready!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shifted twenty tons of coal!&rdquo; said I, surprised. &ldquo;It must have taken him
      some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you don&rsquo;t know what can be done in fine coal with a stream of
      water when you bore it in,&rdquo; snapped the fireman. &ldquo;That wire-tailed
      gabumpus wasn&rsquo;t in there five minutes. He has laid in wait and watched me
      sprinkle coal. He turned her on full bent and bored. I&rsquo;ll get him, and
      I&rsquo;ll get him good!&rdquo; His smudged face went out of sight down the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some ideas in this life which steal up on a man and whisper to
      him, and keep whispering for a long time, until at last he overhears&mdash;and
      then he plans and toils, and in the end an invention results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there are other ideas which march up to a man and hit him on the
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty tons of coal shifted in five minutes by a monkey and a hose! The
      idea that hit me was like a hammer blow. My head wasn&rsquo;t clear all at once;
      I was dizzy. The details were hazy&mdash;but there was the idea hammering
      at me. It was such a glorious idea that I walked aft to that ensign mast,
      looked up, and took off my hat to that monkey. I know he misunderstood my
      act. I know he cursed me as another enemy. But I did not care. I had got
      used to being misunderstood and underrated aboard the <i>Zizania</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned around and found the girl looking at me with wide-open eyes.
      &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t insanity,&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t run in the Sidney family.
      But an idea has just come to me out of a monkey&rsquo;s prank, and it&rsquo;s such a
      wonderful idea that I don&rsquo;t dare to talk about it until I have thought it
      over. I guess you&rsquo;ll have to excuse me, Miss Kama; I&rsquo;ve got to go into my
      state-room and pound at that idea while it is hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not sleep much that night. I was wrestling with a notion as the old
      chap in the Bible wrestled with the angel. And when morning came I was
      positive that an angel of a notion had come to me. I told Captain Holstrom
      at breakfast that I was not going down that day. But when he turned a
      doleful look at me I grinned so amiably that he snapped his eyes,
      thinking, perhaps, that he was not seeing just straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have something to tell you later, Captain. It&rsquo;ll sound better to you
      when I have made certain that we have got stuff aboard here to work out an
      idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That became my business after breakfast&mdash;to hunt the <i>Zizania</i>
      over for certain material. I invited Captain Holstrom along with me, and
      took two men for helpers.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first quest was for hose. The <i>Zizania</i> carried canvas hose for
      fire purposes, stacked here and there on racks. It was not in prime
      condition, for the old <i>Zizania</i> had been condemned along with her
      equipment as far as Government purposes went.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got that hose down and measured it, and found rising two hundred feet
      of stuff that was serviceable. I needed three hundred feet to cover the
      distance between the lighter and the wreck. I made inquiries about canvas.
      The steamer had a suit of sails for her two masts, and the sails had been
      unbent some time before and were stored. Before the day was over Mate
      Number-two Jones had men at work cutting that canvas and sewing it into
      hose of a diameter to fit the fire-hose. Of course, it was crude work, but
      I was obliged to do the best I could with the materials at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening I called a conference. Captain Holstrom, his two mates, and
      Engineer Shank assembled in the wheel-house, and I explained as best I
      could what my preparations meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, please, that at the time of which I am writing hydraulic mining
      had not been tried, and men in those days had no conception of what a
      stream of water would accomplish in moving soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told those blinking confrères that I believed I could direct a stream of
      water on that sand below the sea and bore a hole down to that treasure.
      The only one in the party who showed one glimmer of enthusiasm was Mr.
      Shank. And even he did not get up and hurrah. He nodded his head sagely
      and admitted that &ldquo;stranger things had happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got to use our steam-donkey for your stream,&rdquo; growled Captain
      Holstrom, &ldquo;and you can&rsquo;t get the <i>Zizania</i> any nearer shore than this
      without wrecking her. You&rsquo;re only planning on three hundred feet of hose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I need, Captain. Mr. Shank can build us a plunger-pump with
      brakes, and we&rsquo;ll put the whole crew on to the beams, and have &rsquo;em
      give an imitation of a firemen&rsquo;s muster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Shank nodded again, and allowed that &ldquo;stranger things had been done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you happen to think of this cussed scheme, anyway?&rdquo; inquired
      Captain Holstrom, not trying to hide his disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I promptly decided that I would not confess that the thing had been
      suggested to me by a monkey with a wire tail. I looked at the scowling
      captain, and I could imagine the wealth of his language if I should tell
      him any such thing. So I took all the credit to myself&mdash;and it was
      not much credit I received from those solemn listeners. The most I got out
      of Holstrom was the sullen statement that no matter what I did next the
      situation couldn&rsquo;t be any worse than it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work went on the next day, and the day after, and the day after that.
      It was slow business making that hose so that it would be anyway
      water-tight. And the wooden force-pump took a lot of time in the building,
      rude affair though it was. It had a plunger&mdash;two ends of wood on an
      iron rod, and the brake-beams were long enough so that a dozen men could
      get a clutch on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t remember how much time we used up in getting our makeshift
      apparatus into such shape as would warrant it being used for the trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do remember this&mdash;and remember it all too well!&mdash;before we
      were in readiness for the test of the hose and our pump a small schooner
      came rolling up the coast and anchored well inside of us, even nearer the
      wreck than our lighter from which we had been operating.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was no customs boat. Within a few hours we abroad the <i>Zizania</i>
      knew that Marcena Keedy was in command of the new arrival, and that he had
      brought two divers and was full of hope and curses and brag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where Keedy secured his men and his craft we did not know&mdash;for social
      calls were not exchanged between the two vessels. But a lot can be
      accomplished in a few weeks when a man has greed to prick him, a grudge to
      settle, and twenty thousand dollars to back him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. Rask Holstrom had been in the depths of despair before the arrival
      of Keedy; now he found a hole leading into the subcellar of his despair,
      and retreated still lower. He had no faith in my new contrivances. He
      wanted me to abandon work on such folderols and go down and stand over
      that treasure. He could not seem to see with my eyes. He knew that
      millions in gold were at the bottom of the sea&mdash;I had recovered a
      sample of it. He felt just as though it lay there unprotected, and that
      the first-comer would get it. As a submarine diver who had struggled
      against the difficulties of the situation, I was more serene. I didn&rsquo;t
      know what sort of prodigies in the diving line Keedy had secured as my
      rivals, but I was not ready to admit to myself that they would succeed by
      ordinary means where I had failed after exerting every ounce of effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using Captain Holstrom&rsquo;s long telescope, I saw them going down. They went
      together. Evidently Keedy had concluded that if one diver had failed, two
      ought to be twice as good, and succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom remained at the end of his telescope until he acquired a
      permanent squint. We had hard work to get him to drop the glass long
      enough to eat. Day after day, as soon as it was light in the morning, he
      was in the wheel-house, balancing the glass across the window-sill,
      watching Keedy&rsquo;s schooner. He evidently feared and expected to see
      uncounted wooden boxes of ingots come tumbling up over her rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      My equipment had been almost ready when Keedy arrived, but now another
      consideration held me back. I did not propose to let the other crowd in on
      my methods if I could help it. No matter what Captain Holstrom and his
      associates thought of the feasibility of the scheme, I had a lot of
      confidence in it, and was not willing that a rival should know enough
      about it to copy any plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore I set my crew at work building a wall of boards about the
      lighter, leaving only a door for my exit over the side. I wanted to
      conceal the pumping operations. As to the divers whom I should meet at the
      scene of the wreck, I trusted to other measures to conceal my system.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was out on the lighter to superintend the building of the wall, and more
      especially to oversee the setting of the force-pump and its attachments. I
      did not like the looks of the sea on that last day of our work. It looked
      murky and slaty as the big rollers surged under us, and I remembered that
      it showed that same color on the day when my friendly undertow had helped
      me. I was tempted to go down and investigate, but I had seen the men from
      Keedy&rsquo;s schooner go overboard, and I concluded to keep away from contact
      with them until I was ready for serious operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inclosed in my wall on the lighter, I was busy about my own affairs, and
      did not peep to see what was happening in the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom remained on the <i>Zizania</i>, in close companionship of
      his only intimate of those days&mdash;his long telescope. But Kama
      Holstrom was at my side while I worked, cheering me by her wise little
      comments, her bright eyes taking all in, her quick mind grasping all the
      possibilities of my scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a rather cheerful little group there in our pen. Even Number-two
      Jones was whistling in jig time, for all the apparatus was fitting
      together as slick as a school-marm&rsquo;s hand in a fur mitten. And then in
      through the door burst a human thunderbolt in the form of Capt. Rask
      Holstrom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was bareheaded and his gray hair was scruffed up like the bristling
      mane of a mad bulldog. He was not able to manage words for about a minute,
      but he wasn&rsquo;t voiceless by any manner of means. He roared and leaped about
      and smote his fists together. He picked up our hose and flung it about
      himself like an insane snake charmer. He kicked at the wooden pump with
      his stubtoed shoes until I was obliged to push him away. Then he grabbed
      the hose once more, and reeled it about himself in senseless fury, for all
      the world like a caterpillar weaving its cocoon. His square face was a war
      map of rage, and in the center of that face his red nose gleamed like a
      danger signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stood and gaped at him. There wasn&rsquo;t much else we could do as long as
      he remained in that awful state. He paid no attention to his daughter&rsquo;s
      questions and appeals.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a peep through the cracks of the boarding to see whether the old <i>Zizania</i>
      were still afloat; I had a horrified suspicion that she had sunk or
      burned. She floated serenely, sweeping up and down on the crested waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      After letting off his surplus of steam in howls, Captain Holstrom was able
      to manage speech at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting it! I&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em
      pull two boxes of it over their rail, and they&rsquo;re dancing jubilee around
      the deck.&rdquo; He flung down the coils of hose, and stamped on it, and spat
      the most vicious oaths I ever listened to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting it&mdash;they&rsquo;ve got it&mdash;and all you&rsquo;re doing here
      is fooling with a damnation squirt-gun that ain&rsquo;t no sense and no good&mdash;and
      I told you so in the first place. Keedy was right. I ought to have stuck
      to Keedy. I&rsquo;ve known Keedy. He was a friend of mine till you came along
      and broke us up. I had promised my girl to him. He ain&rsquo;t setting around
      darning second-hand canvas&rdquo;&mdash;he kicked the hose&mdash;&ldquo;when he ought
      to be up and about, doing real business.&rdquo; He rushed at me and clacked his
      fists under my nose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all done with you! I&rsquo;m going to Keedy and
      crawfish and offer him the steamer and my equipment for a lay with him and
      his men. I&rsquo;ll offer him my girl. You&rsquo;ll marry him if I have to hold you up
      in front of the minister by the ears!&rdquo; he informed her, whirling and
      shaking his fists under her nose, too. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had all the silly notions and
      lallygagging I propose to have, and what I say goes after this. It&rsquo;s
      business from now on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started to plunge back through the door like a down through a hoop. A
      couple of his men were holding a yawl beside the lighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had used my submarine grip on Captain Holstrom once before when he was
      drunk. I used it now when he was sober&mdash;and the grip held. I grabbed
      him and yanked him back, slammed the door, and set myself against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t dissolve partnership with me in any such way,&rdquo; I informed him.
      &ldquo;Especially not right now, just as I&rsquo;ve got the world by the tail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you whether I can dissolve partnership or not,&rdquo; he barked; and
      he began running about the inclosure, roaring threats and peering here and
      there. He was plainly hunting for a weapon of some sort in order to beat
      me away from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kama!&rdquo; I called to her&mdash;the first time I had ever addressed her so
      familiarly, but that was no time for niceties. &ldquo;Kama, it&rsquo;s no use to plead
      with your father. He&rsquo;s no better than a lunatic. He&rsquo;s going to throw
      everything into the hands of that thief of a Keedy. It mustn&rsquo;t be done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain had found a dub and was coming at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put herself between us. He knew better than to raise his club against
      her, and he kept dodging back and forth to get past her. He paid no
      attention to her protests and appeals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Shank&mdash;Mr. Jones,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;take that club away from my
      father. He is not in his right mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be mutiny&mdash;mutiny and State prison,&rdquo; stammered the mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m his daughter&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go into court if it ever comes to that! I
      order you to do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep the others off, and I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; I said in her ear, and I rushed
      past her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holstrom struck at me viciously, but my rush had taken him by surprise. I
      caught his arm and the stick, and tore the weapon away from him. But to
      down him and subdue him was a different proposition&mdash;and a very husky
      job he made of it for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was broad and sturdy; he was sober, and he was beside himself with
      rage. The spectacle of that gold going into the hands of Keedy and his
      gang had made a lunatic of him for the time being. I got no help from the
      others. Men of the sea and ships, they had a wholesome tear of what would
      happen to mutineers when that matter came into court. I struggled with
      that old rascal until every muscle in me throbbed with the pain of
      tension, and I thought the blood would burst through my face. No matter
      about the details of that long fight. But at last I got him down; I rolled
      him on his face. I pulled his hands together, kneeling on him, and the
      girl lashed his wrists together when I appealed to her. She lashed his
      legs as well, for I decided to take no chances with him while he was in
      that mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got my breath I leaned over him and spoke my little piece:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is tough business for all of us, Captain Holstrom. I don&rsquo;t know what
      may come out of it. I&rsquo;m prepared to take my medicine if I&rsquo;ve done wrong.
      But you have started in to run amuck. You ought to know what Keedy is by
      this time. He has done you once. He would do you worse the next time. If
      you weren&rsquo;t crazy at this minute you&rsquo;d realize it. I don&rsquo;t propose to
      stand by and see you heave your best chance over the rail in any such
      fashion. I demand twenty-four hours to make good on my scheme. Twenty-four
      hours&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. I know how those men got that gold. I got mine in
      the same way. But they won&rsquo;t get any more; I know conditions down there;
      I&rsquo;ve been all through it. You listen to me, I say! I&rsquo;m going to take
      twenty-four hours&mdash;and if I&rsquo;ve got to keep you tied up while I
      operate, then it&rsquo;s tied up you stay. I&rsquo;ll take all the responsibility of
      this mutiny, men,&rdquo; I told the crowd on the lighter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a partner in this
      expedition with a signed contract. Twenty-four hours from now I&rsquo;ll hold
      out my hands and let you tie me up if I haven&rsquo;t made good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was pretty bold talk, and I&rsquo;ll confess that I did not know just where
      I was going to get off. But to let Captain Holstrom run away to that rogue
      of a Keedy just when I was on the eve of my experiment&mdash;to allow
      Holstrom to hand over everything to that he-devil&mdash;was too
      intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take the captain back to the steamer,&rdquo; I told the men. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      assuming all responsibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll share it with you,&rdquo; said the girl, stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom seemed to have lost his voice. He stared at us and gasped
      like a fish newly heaved on deck. He was silent while we carried him to
      his state-room on the steamer. We left him tied up well and his daughter
      was his caretaker and jailer by her own choice. She was showing the grit
      of a young catamount in that emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of it was about as bad as it could be. But it was going to be worse.

    <h2>
      XXXIII&mdash;THE HEART OF THE MILLIONS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> WAS about at
      daybreak next morning. The man who predicted the first eclipse of the sun
      and was waiting for it had nothing on me in the way of a case of nerves. I
      kept away from the captain&rsquo;s state-room. I had plenty on my mind without
      loading up with any more trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing I saw when I came on deck was a little schooner which was
      lying-to a few cable-lengths from us. She looked familiar. A boat was slid
      over her rail. Through the telescope I saw two men in uniform take seats
      in the stem-sheets. They were those customs chaps who had visited us
      before and they rowed past us toward Keedy&rsquo;s schooner. I turned the
      telescope and saw that somebody in Keedy&rsquo;s crowd was wigwagging a flag
      furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw something else through the glass. Keedy&rsquo;s divers were going down and
      I could imagine with what kind of tongue-lashing he had been urging them
      to &ldquo;follow their hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant I had a wild notion of calling for my boat crew and beating
      them to it. Then I looked out over that quieter sea, and felt sure that
      the freakish undertow had gone off to play elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em go down and learn a thing or two,&rdquo; I said to Romeo Shank,
      &ldquo;and then come up and tell Keedy that the Pacific Ocean is something, of a
      gambler itself when it comes to &lsquo;following your hand.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew well enough that I&rsquo;d better stick around pretty close aboard the
      old <i>Zizania</i>, for I was sure we would be receiving a call from the
      customs men. They would find our treasury bare, and they would find the
      captain of the expedition trussed up in his state-room. They would
      probably come with another &ldquo;hot rock&rdquo; which had been dropped in their hat
      by the prospering Keedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there was only one station for me that morning!
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitors arrived in less than an hour. They tried to smile when they
      came over the rail, but it was a mighty sick smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      I led them into my state-room, and did not pay any attention to their
      questions about the captain. They talked broken English, and little of it,
      and so there were no words wasted. In a few minutes I knew what was
      wanted. We must up killick and get out. We were there without authority;
      we were breaking laws; we were stealing other men&rsquo;s property.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to talk about Keedy and his gang. How about them? The officers
      shrugged their shoulders and scowled at me. Ah, that was the Government&rsquo;s
      business, not mine, they told me. They were attending to that case. Had I
      not seen them going over there also? Yes, all should be used alike&mdash;but
      we must go or else they would report, and a gunboat would be sent to drive
      us away&mdash;yes, to confiscate our ship. So!
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom had been right in regard to them&mdash;I found that they
      were blood-suckers, looking for the juiciest proposition, and Keedy had
      got next by some plan&mdash;perhaps by being a better liar.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stared at those knaves for a few moments, and did some tall thinking
      quickly. I was really getting used to quick thinking by that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I jumped up and asked to be excused for a moment they smiled and
      settled back on the transom. Perhaps they thought that I proposed to raise
      Keedy out of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Mate Number-two Jones on the main deck forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have called the turn on us&mdash;say that we must get off the
      coast,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;Keedy has bribed them over our heads. I tell you,
      Jones, I&rsquo;m going to get that treasure! I&rsquo;ve got to get it. This isn&rsquo;t mere
      brag talk. You are posted on my plans, and you believe in them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scheme does look good to me,&rdquo; admitted the mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If those men leave here tied up to Keedy they&rsquo;ll send a gunboat and shoo
      us off&mdash;and they&rsquo;ve told Keedy, of course, how to dodge her. Jones,
      those men have got to stay aboard the <i>Zizania</i> until I make my try
      to-day. And, by the gods! I&rsquo;ll bring up enough to show &rsquo;em that we
      are the people. You come with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to lasso those chaps and hitch &rsquo;em to the stanchion in
      my state-room. They&rsquo;ve got to stay here till I test out that hose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; objected Mr. Jones, fumbling at his nose, &ldquo;seems to me
      there&rsquo;s altogether too much tripping and tying aboard here. It beats a
      round-up of steers. We&rsquo;re going to get into a lot of trouble&mdash;we&rsquo;re
      in it now. You wait till the captain gets loose, and see if we ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tying two more won&rsquo;t make it any worse than it is. I can&rsquo;t make you do
      what you don&rsquo;t want to do, Jones, but I believe you&rsquo;re too much of a man
      to let me play this thing single-handed. We&rsquo;re fighting Keedy now. If I
      fail in getting at that gold to-day, all we&rsquo;ve got to do is to up mud-hook
      and steam north&mdash;we&rsquo;ll have to do the same thing if we let those
      grafters go over the rail now.&rdquo; Jones was a cautious man, but he was a
      loyal one. I kept on urging, and at last the battle-light flickered in his
      pale-blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blast their thievish souls!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve taken all the money I had
      in my pockets&mdash;and now they&rsquo;re thumbing their noses at decent men.
      I&rsquo;m with you!&rdquo; We grabbed ropes, rushed up to my state-room, and fell on
      the men before they could scramble to their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were wizened little chaps and we tied them without any trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I went below and leaned over the rail where their boat was tossing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentlemen are staying here for some business,&rdquo; I told the two rowers.
      &ldquo;They tell you to go back to the schooner and wait till they signal for
      you with our ensign.&rdquo; They didn&rsquo;t look entirely satisfied, but they rowed
      away after I had ordered them to fend off.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stationed two men at my state-room door and I hunted up weapons and
      armed some of the crew. I ordered them to keep off everybody until I
      returned from the lighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke to Captain Holstrom through his state-room window. I told him that
      I would bring him a present before sundown. He did not reply&mdash;and
      when Captain Holstrom was mad enough to keep his tongue between his teeth
      I felt that only murder could express his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was on the hook, and a little brown hand was thrust out to meet
      mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck, brave boy!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fail after that word from you,&rdquo; I told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I ran down the ladder and jumped into the boat where my men were
      waiting for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found a heavy surge running under our lighter, but the swirl of sand was
      no longer darkening the water. I had reckoned right in regard to that
      undertow. Keedy&rsquo;s men were still down and I could imagine them wasting
      their strength on the sand which had been packed back overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our water-hose had already been coupled in makeshift fashion, and the last
      work that morning was to wrap the joints as best we could. Then I set the
      men at the brakes and told them to &ldquo;give her tar,&rdquo; as the old-fashioned
      hand-tub foreman would say. The hose was strung about the deck of the
      lighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      After they pumped for five minutes I found that the hose was not so tight
      as I had hoped. Wheezing little streams punctured it here and there, and
      the joints leaked. From the end of our home-made nozzle of sheet iron the
      stream barely trickled. I was disgusted&mdash;but I was not wholly
      discouraged. When I state this you may see how desperate I had become. I
      was resolved to fight that thing through to the last ditch. I was
      determined to take that hose down and try it out. I had the misty and
      hopeful notion that the pressure of the sea on it might make some
      difference, that the wet hose might retain the water better, that after
      the plunger had swelled a bit we might get more force.
    </p>
    <p>
      All those straws and others did I grab at by way of bracing my courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the expedition trussed up in his cabin like a steer calf&mdash;only
      waiting his opportunity to deal with me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Two customs men also trussed up&mdash;also waiting to deal with me!
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be readily understood that there were some decidedly red-hot goads
      at my back that day to drive me down under the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not been able to convince Captain Holstrom that all my work and
      struggles and investigation and failures up to then were a good
      investment. But as a submarine diver I knew that they had been. I had been
      spending my nights on a sleepless pillow, docketing those experiences and
      drawing lessons from them&mdash;plotting, pondering, and planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went down I was ready for my job in so far as a man, by pounding
      his brain, can be ready for all emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had piled the lead on to myself. Around my body from hips to armpits I
      had a canvas belt with five pockets, each pocket holding twenty-five
      pounds of shot, part of the junk of the old <i>Zizania</i>. Around each
      leg above the ankle I fastened another bag of shot holding fifteen pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      My helmet had weights weighing thirty pounds. In addition I wore my
      regular breast and back weights. That is to say, when I was rolled over
      the side of that lighter I, a one-hundred-and-eighty-pound man, was
      weighted with about two hundred and fifty pounds of metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went with bare feet and bare hands. I knew that if I ever did succeed in
      boring that sand, holding that hose in my hands, my feet would have to
      serve as hands for the purpose of feeling out objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keedy&rsquo;s men had come up before I gave the word to lower me. Number-two
      Jones had peered through the cracks of the boarding, and had reported that
      they had come over the rail without bringing treasure, and that Keedy was
      stamping up and down the deck, wagging his fists over his head. I could
      imagine from my own experience what kind of language the cowardly
      slave-driver was spewing out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found myself on the bottom under the lighter, and started to make my way
      toward the wreck. I was loaded like a pack-donkey, outside of the
      tremendous extra weight of lead I carried. But I was taking everything
      which my judgment counseled as needful for success.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to drag with me my life-line, my air-hose, and the heavy
      canvas hose for the water. In addition to those, I towed a double line
      which was hitched to a pair of ice-tongs, and the points of those tongs
      were filed to a sharp point. I carried the tongs at my belt. If I found
      treasure I had this method of sending it to the lighter and of dragging
      back the tongs to myself. I had had one experience in serving as a carrier
      and I did not want to repeat the job.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tell you, I felt like a mighty poor and puny little ant when I started
      away on the bottom of the sea, climbing those sand ridges. The sea
      clutched and tore at those wriggling lines, at my air-hose, and was
      especially ferocious in tackling that heavy water-hose. It seemed as if
      the Pacific resented that scheme of fighting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a mighty struggle I had. I was tossed and tumbled. I was banged and
      buffeted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the end I arrived at the wreck. Under ordinary circumstances that
      stunt alone would have finished a diver&rsquo;s work for a day&mdash;but I had
      left matters above the surface in such condition that I could not face
      them just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dropped my water-hose, and went back fifty feet along the line. Past
      experience with the weight of the surges had suggested another trick with
      which to fight the giant Pacific. I had brought a small anchor, and, with
      this set into the sand as best I cou&rsquo;d do it, I anchored my air-hose and
      water-hose about fifty feet from the wreck. I proposed to let the ocean
      wreak the most of its spite on the two hundred and fifty feet between that
      anchor and the lighter. I figured that I might be able to handle the other
      fifty feet, no matter how ugly the surges were.
    </p>
    <p>
      I crawled back to the wreck and found my bearings. There were the &ldquo;cat
      scratchings&rdquo; on the sand where the other divers had spent their energy
      that morning. I grinned&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t help it. They had just had their
      own experience with the tricks of a Pacific undertow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the great and awful moment had come for me!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the years that have passed since then the vivid memory of that moment
      has never left me. I wake up in the night even now, and the thrill of it
      shakes me.
    </p>
    <p>
      If my scheme did not work, what would become of me when I went back to the
      surface of the sea?
    </p>
    <p>
      If my scheme did work, what was I facing down there? I was proposing to
      bore into that sand&mdash;to sink into it. No such plan had ever been
      tried by a human being up to that time. Was I not digging my own grave?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Although sticking a statement of fact into writing which
     is professedly fiction may be considered supererogation by
     the cynical critic, some honest reader may be grateful for a
     certain bit of information. Here it is: My old and valued
     friend, the diver who recovered the <i>Golden Gate</i> treasure,
     still lives at a ripe age and he has detailed to me how he
     devised the hydraulic apparatus out of makeshift material,
     how he bored into the sand, and how he, with his own hands,
     recovered the bullion. Also, the incident of his narrow
     escape when the water-hose shifted was a part of his bitter
     experience on the bed of the Pacific. I hasten to state
     that, so far as the rest of the yam goes, my good friend,
     Diver Cook, is not culpable.&mdash;H. D.
</pre>
    <p>
      I sat down on the sand, Turk fashion, like a tailor on his table, pointed
      the nozzle down, holding it against the sand, and gave the agreed-upon
      signal for water. It took a long time in coming, and it was an agony of
      waiting. Then at last I felt the hose swell under my arm. I pressed the
      nozzle harder against the sand. I cannot describe my delight. I felt that
      my dreams were coming true, for when I jammed the nozzle down I found that
      the sand was moving. That stream had merely trickled above the surface,
      but now a pressure was created when I held the nozzle hard against the
      bottom of the sea. Yes, the sand moved under me. It began to boil up
      around me. It swept and swirled in yellow clouds. I realized that I was
      boring a hole about as big as a barrel, and into that hole I was gradually
      sinking. I was on my way! I did not know where I was going&mdash;but,
      bless the good Lord, I was on my way! The sand in that boiling water made
      all dark. Down and down I went slowly, my bare feet searching eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though I descended more rapidly as the swirling motion increased, I
      felt no boxes. Had I, then, happened upon a straggler among the boxes of
      gold on my earlier trip? Had my rivals also found two more stragglers from
      the main treasure&mdash;loosened boxes which had been forced out of the
      chamber by the impact of the wreck on the bar or had worked near the
      surface of the sand by the action of a sucking undertow? If that were
      true, it meant that Keedy&rsquo;s men were dumped if they stuck to shovels.
      Provided I could reach the treasure, and could keep my own system a
      secret, I was headed toward a glorious victory, and could depend upon the
      ocean to keep off others&mdash;but was I headed toward victory? My feet
      touched nothing that had square corners. And yet, to the best of my
      judgment, I had already gone down at least ten feet in that hole in the
      sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down and down&mdash;five feet more, so I reckoned. Then my heart gave a
      jump. My feet had touched something. It was smooth and hard and flat, and
      spread under me horizontally. But I soon discovered that it had too large
      a surface to be a box of ingots. I could not bend over to feel it with my
      hands, for the rush of the whirlpool of sand and water about me, sweeping
      upward, would not allow me to force my helmet and the upper part of my
      body down. I must depend on my bare feet to tell me what I had struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time I knew. It was boiler plate. I could feel the round heads of
      bolts. Whether this plate formed a part of the treasure-chamber or not I
      did not know. But it was an obstacle which must be passed. I turned my
      nozzle in front of me to clear the way. I wanted to reach the end of that
      iron plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two ticks of an eight-day clock I was in a mess that has been my
      nightmare ever since. I began to get a thorough education in what sand
      will do under water when it is submitted to the force of a stream from a
      hose. The instant I turned that nozzle in front of me the sand rushed in
      from behind. I was grabbed as tightly as though the eight feelers of a
      devil-fish had encircled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be remembered that this whole proposition was an experiment so far
      as I was concerned. I did not know then how quickly a stream of water can
      affect great quantities of sand under the sea, let that sand get in
      motion. Tons can be moved almost while one takes a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      This shift was so sudden that I was not prepared for it. My legs were
      pinioned, and my arms seemed to be clutched at the elbows. The sand was
      packing in around me from behind. I was so scared that my hands loosened
      on the nozzle. A roller snatched the hose from my grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nozzle was upended and began to sizzle away over my head. It kept the
      sand moving there, and the murky water still swirled about my helmet, and
      the pack was not allowed to settle on my head. But as to the rest of my
      body, it was as if I had been immersed in molten metal and it had cooled
      around me. In a few seconds I was immovable. I was buried completely in
      sand, except for my wrists and hands. In clutching for the hose, as it had
      been yanked away, I had raised my hands above my head, and they were now
      waving in the swirl of the whirlpool. I groped and stretched and strove,
      and at last I felt the tips of my fingers on the nozzle. I managed, after
      a while, to tilt it down a bit so that the stream played along my arms to
      the elbows. The temporary release of my forearms did not help me. I
      couldn&rsquo;t get hold of that hose so as to turn the nozzle full upon myself.
      The sand kept packing more closely about my legs and body.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time my aching hands and arms were obliged to give up the fight. I
      had become so weakened by my struggles and strainings that I was faint&mdash;I
      was as feeble as a baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have read about men in awful peril who have resigned themselves to die.
      Mentally I was not resigned when I first gave up struggling&mdash;not for
      some time. I came out of that first faintness, wide awake to my danger,
      filled with frightful fear, mad with the longing to live. But my case
      seemed hopeless. The stream was keeping the sand in motion still about my
      helmet and over my head, but my hands informed me that the pack was
      gradually settling, that the sand was piling up around my neck slowly but
      surely. In the boil of that water the particles were drifting over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I might live minutes, I reflected&mdash;I might linger there for an hour
      or more&mdash;feeling that sand pack around my head until it choked the
      valve of the helmet or pinched off the current in the air-hose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was I so hungry for life as when I stood there pinioned hand and
      foot in the Pacific&rsquo;s bed, feeling the sand piling up against the glass of
      my helmet, sifting around me to chink the little cranny where the air
      bubbled from the valve. And all because a stream of water would not swerve
      ten inches and pour itself in my direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then something surprising happened to my soul in its agony. I&rsquo;m telling
      the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had made up my mind that effort was useless, that I had done all
      that I could do, and that death was certain, a strange feeling came to me
      and took away my fear of death. I fell into a quiet and really exalted
      frame of mind. I floated in dreams. Cares of earth and worries of the
      world, lust for gold, and even the love of woman seemed very small
      matters. What did it all matter? I was dying. Peace came to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it not probable that kind nature or a kinder God thus smooths the way
      into eternity when the great moment comes? Men who have been nigh the last
      gasp have swapped stories with me and we all agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no notion of the length of time I had been down. In my mistiness of
      mind I did not bother about time. In the case of a submarine diver, the
      hours are marked off by his sensations, and he knows when he has stayed
      down long enough. If my men had told me that I had been on the bed of the
      ocean for a day and a night I should not have disputed them. I must have
      been near death, for it is said that when one is dying all of life that
      has been lived comes before the mind and passes in review, as though the
      mortal soul were preparing its brief for the use of the recording angel. I
      remember that this last was a strange idea which came to me there in the
      sand-pack which was slowly heaping itself over my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then something happened. It was something which should have amazed me, but
      I reckon that my brain was too numbed to feel amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nozzle above my head gave a sudden yank and rapped my knuckles. It
      righted itself. That is to say, it aimed downward and began to pour water
      directly at and over me. I felt the stream rather than saw it. I could not
      see in that smother of sand. But my arms came out of the mold in which
      they had been pinned. I grabbed and groped for that hose with all the
      desperation that was in me. I held to it with all my strength. It was
      lucky that I seized it as I did, for I felt the rollers tugging at it once
      more as though some devil of the sea had given me one more chance in order
      to tantalize me, and was now resolved to finish me finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not know what had happened above to cause the sudden deflection of
      the stream. It was enough for me to know that some freak of the waters had
      turned the hose. I found out later what had occurred, and I may as well
      explain at this point, lest you think I have told merely of a case of
      story-book Providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have related how I anchored my lines fifty feet from the wreck. That
      anchor, so I found later, had been pulled out of the sand, and the surges
      had bellied the water-hose in toward shore, over my head, and the aim of
      the nozzle had been changed in the snap of a finger. It surely had been
      touch and go with me, for once the surge had taken up the slack the next
      wave must have jerked the hose out of my hole. I had grabbed just in time;
      I had melted my sand mold and was free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Common sense advised me to quit the job forever. The uncertainties of
      trying to move sand with a stream of water had been impressed upon me in
      horrible fashion. But common sense is not allowed to rule a man when he is
      after gold in this world. I had found out what that stream would
      accomplish if it was used properly. I had learned one lesson which I could
      not forget, and I was sure I would not make the mistake of letting the
      sand catch me from behind again. I knew, on the other hand, what would
      happen to me when I appeared above the surface without my ransom fee of
      yellow gold. I preferred to stay and fight sand instead of men. There, in
      the boil of the roiled water, I resolved to stay down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried another experiment with the hose, and was-, vastly encouraged. I
      had been worrying and wondering how I would get back out of the hole, for
      I feared that the-life-line, playing over the edge of the sand, would not
      allow the men on the lighter enough direct pull; to help me much. Now I
      needed to rise from the hole for a littleway in order to attack the sand
      at another angle so as to pass that plate of boiler iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      I slackened the force of the stream from the nozzle with my palm, and the
      sand began to pack in below me. The uprush of the swirling water helped me
      and I was able to work myself slowly upward. Then I began to. bore again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I realized now that something must have happened to, my anchor, because
      the rollers were giving me battle for-the possession of that water-hose in
      fierce style. But I hung on, and found myself sinking into the sand. I
      went, down more rapidly, for I had already softened the surrounding pack.
      After the awful experience I had just had, I was more of a lunatic than
      sane while I made that, second attempt. My brain swirled as dizzily as the
      water which swept up from the hole. As nearly as I could estimate, I went
      down at least five yards before I struck anything that was solid. And when
      my feet, already sore from the grinding of that sand, felt what was below
      them, the whole of my being gave three cheers&mdash;not cheers with, the
      mouth, but those silent cheers with which a man&rsquo;s soul yells its joy. I
      had touched a box. There were its comers&mdash;there was its unmistakable
      shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      After wild struggles and contortions, I was able to set the points of the
      ice-tongs into its sides. I gave the signal on the drag-rope, and I could
      feel the surge of the men on the line. But the angle of the rope over the
      edge of the hole would not allow them to lift very hard. The box was too
      far away from the lighter for their efforts to amount to much. But as they
      swayed away I kept the hose playing upon the box and under it. It did seem
      damnably slow work. But it came up, inch by inch, slowly and surely, until
      I was out of the hole, and standing about knee-deep in the sand. I had a
      tug of war of it then!
    </p>
    <p>
      The box was not out of the hole. The rollers tugged at my lines and
      wrenched at me. Once or twice I was fairly floored. I would fall with my
      legs pinioned fast, and would lie exhausted until I could get strength to
      stand up and wash myself free with the hose. In order to get back out of
      that hole at all, I was obliged to slacken the stream and let the sand
      pack in under myself and the box&mdash;and when the stream slackened I was
      obliged to drag my legs out of the packing sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was free at last, bless the good Lord! And I had a box of gold. It
      was not a mere stray box, salvaged with the help of a freakish undertow.
      It was a box which I had torn from the heart of the hoard below. Yes, I
      was sure that I had been to the heart of the treasure. And where I had
      been the Pacific was already stuffing back the sand, locking the door once
      more on the gold it had taken for its own. Let Keedy&rsquo;s men come down! Let
      them waste their strength. I had the key to that situation&mdash;and I
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tugged a signal to shut off the water. And as promptly I gave them
      pull-up signals on my life-line and on the drag-cord of the tongs. I
      wanted to get above the sea and breathe the fresh air of the good God, and
      look into the eye of the blessed sun, and give praises. And, oh, the awful
      weariness in every bone and muscle of me! I lay down and let &rsquo;em
      pull me back. I had no strength with which to manage that weight of metal
      which loaded me down.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they got me upon the deck of the lighter, and had twisted off my
      helmet, I lay for a long time without words. I motioned to Number-two
      Jones to remove the cover from the box I had brought. The sight of those
      ingots gave me the goad once more&mdash;ah, it takes gold to make the
      human soul gallop!=
    </p>
    <p>
      `````"Gold, gold, yellow gold,
    </p>
    <p>
      `````Hard to get and harder to hold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This quotation burst from Mr. Shank. His round face was radiant, and he
      came and leaned over me and patted me on the head. He did not seem to have
      any better way of showing his joy. It was a wildly excited crew which
      crowded around me; they were still more excited when I sat up on deck at
      last and told them I was going down again. The fever was in me. I wanted
      to go back to the <i>Zizania</i> with gold enough, to convince Captain
      Holstrom and those knaves of customs men that there was no fluke about our
      proposition. I wanted to raise that infernal Keedy out of this game for
      good and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was mighty tempestuous water in the vicinity of the wreck, and putting
      the lighter nearer was not to be thought of. But I discussed with Mate
      Jones the possibility of dropping our yawl back toward the wreck at the
      end of a cable, so that the men could lift the treasure-boxes more
      directly. We had brought extra men that morning for the pump, and a crew
      for the surf-boat volunteered. The gold lust was seizing the whole of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went down again, feeling sure that the wicked labor of getting the box
      up through the sand would be lightened for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took another anchor, and on my way to the wreck I refastened my hose
      lines to the bottom, rigging the second anchor as a bridle, so that the
      strain would be eased on the one which I had set into the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down I bored again, my tongs at my belt, my hose in my clutch. And I
      stayed down until I had sent three more boxes up to the surf-boat. While I
      was toiling down there I knew that I was setting a dangerous record for
      myself&mdash;I could not hope to equal it on the days which were to
      follow. It was plain that I had penetrated to the heart of the treasure,
      but I had penetrated to other things as well. I found all the sculch and
      broken crockery of the wrecked pantry and the bar of the <i>Golden Gate</i>.
      Yes, I sent three more boxes to the lighter; but when I crawled over the
      rail later my hands and feet were bleeding, and the sand had ground into
      the wounds. Already my skin showed where the grinding of the boiling sand
      was wearing the epidermis. Even the rubber of my suit was showing wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was a sorry-looking object when I staggered into Capt. Rask Holstrom&rsquo;s
      state-room. He fairly slavered in his rage and tried to leap at me. I
      reckon I did look like a beaten man. But the next instant my men came
      tramping in with the boxes of gold. There were four of these glorious
      boxes, and each one was open and showed the ingots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend Keedy got his two boxes by the fluke of an undertow,&rdquo; I told
      him. &ldquo;I have got mine by science and a system which will give us the rest
      of it. Now, Captain Holstrom, I&rsquo;ll accept your apologies.&rdquo; And I cut him
      loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not mention any apologies due from me to him. I wanted to rub it
      into the old squarehead so thoroughly that he would never get the smart of
      it out of his skin. I wanted to let him know that I had set a ring into
      his nose, and that if he ever tried to run amuck again I was the man who
      could catch him and trip him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave me one look, gasped one gasp, and I knew that Capt. Rask Holstrom
      had abdicated his throne. I was boss. But I had no time to listen to his
      slobbering thanks just then. I took one of those bars of gold in my bloody
      hand and started for my state-room. I shook the ingot under the noses of
      those customs men. And they, too, knew that I was boss when I got through
      with them. I had not come back that day from hell and the bottom of the
      sea to mince words with any loafers&mdash;Captain Holstrom included.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s gold worth four thousand dollars in good Yankee money, you
      low-down renegades. You take it and get off this steamer. If you are good,
      and come around here like gentlemen about a month from now, perhaps I&rsquo;ll
      drop another rock into your hat. I don&rsquo;t promise&mdash;it all depends on
      how you act. But if you come back too quick&mdash;if you try to squeeze us
      for more rake-off&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go down to headquarters and buy your blessed
      Government, and have you put into prison or shot&mdash;for before this
      thing is ended here I&rsquo;ll have more than three million dollars behind me.
      Now you can either make a dollar quietly or you can make trouble. Suit
      yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I cut their ropes and pushed them out of the room and ordered our ensign
      set to signal their boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t have to offer them any apologies, either, and I was not in an
      apologizing mood that day. They did the apologizing while they were
      waiting for their boat, and I scowled while they were begging me to
      forgive the mistake they had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I felt pretty much like the boss of the outfit. But when Kama
      Holstrom came with hot water and a basin and bandages and ordered me into
      my state-room, I went as meekly as a slave who trembles when the finger of
      his master is pointed.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> DID not go down
      next day, and I watched the descent of Keedy&rsquo;s divers with indifference
      that was pretty nigh serene. Captain Holstrom stamped around restlessly,
      for he couldn&rsquo;t seem to get it into his mind that the Pacific Ocean was on
      guard. But he did not venture to make any suggestions to me, and I decided
      that I had trained him in pretty fair shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had good reason for delaying my next descent. It would not do to take
      chances with my diving-dress, which was showing signs of being frayed by
      the swirling sand, and I put in a busy day with the two Joneses, stitching
      an extra canvas suit to wear over the rubber dress. I improved on the
      ice-tongs by having a set of steel spring hooks made so that by means of
      long handles I could push them over a box without stooping and fumbling.
      Also I had a long rod of steel turned out for me, and with this I could
      probe the sand for boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no way of knowing whether Keedy or his divers suspected that I had
      secured any treasure. I knew that after a night of action of the sea there
      would be few traces left where I had disturbed the sand. But I also knew
      that Keedy would certainly be wondering why we had built the wall around
      the lighter, and therefore we doubled the guards who had spent the night
      there since we had installed the pump, and gave the men orders to shoot
      any man who tried to climb on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started work on a bigger and more elaborate pump, having tested out the
      principle of the thing by means of the first one. I needed more stream.
      While Shank was building this I went to work again, using the old
      equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited each day until the other divers had been down and had climbed
      back into the sunlight, empty-handed. Then I slid overboard from our
      lighter as secretly as possible, and did my day&rsquo;s work. I averaged three
      boxes a. trip by working myself to the limit of my endurance. It was
      reported to me that Keedy climbed into the rigging of the schooner
      whenever the surf-boat was eased back toward the wreck, and that he
      remained there on watch. How much he saw we did not know, but the men in
      the boat crowded together whenever a box was raised. From what I learned
      afterward, I found that Keedy thought we were operating some kind of a
      dredge, and that his divers reported to him that we were not making any
      impression on the sand. So he sat calmly in the rigging, spying on what he
      could see, and reckoning that we were wasting our time the same as his
      crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the end of a week the new pump was finished and I had almost five
      hundred gallons a minute at my command.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not mean to be profane, but I must state that when I got that new
      stream to operating it was hell for me down below&mdash;and no other
      phrase seems to express the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already mentioned the refuse of that wrecked pantry and bar; from
      out of the holes I bored rushed up bits of broken bottles and crockery,
      slashing at my bare feet and hands. I could not protect them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stream from the nozzle&mdash;a three-inch stream&mdash;stirred such a
      mush of sand that I worked in pitch darkness. I had to have bare feet and
      hands in order to feel my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time, my feet were swollen to twice their natural size.
      Finger-nails and toe-nails had been worn off by the grinding of the sand,
      and the skin had been eaten off. The sand even penetrated my dress, and my
      knees and shoulders were chafed raw. My back, under the dragging weights I
      was forced to wear, was about like a piece of pounded steak. I was
      suffering the limit of human agony, but I was mad for success&mdash;I was
      crazed by the gold lust. I was bringing out a small fortune every day; one
      day I recovered six boxes&mdash;one hundred and twenty thousand dollars!
      But I was still just as hungry for the gold that remained at the bottom. I
      set my teeth, gasped back my groans, and kept at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the tender ministrations of Kama Holstrom could not mend my hurts, and
      I would not listen to her appeals to me. She begged me to give up the
      fight. She urged that we had enough. But I was as crazy as the wildest man
      who ever hunted gold, and the pain I was in made me more of a lunatic. On
      several occasions I was pulled back to the lighter in a dead faint, and
      fought with Number-two Jones because he would not send me down again that
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot go into the details of those days of nightmare. I can only say
      that I kept on.
    </p>
    <p>
      We soon had plain hints that Keedy was getting suspicious and uneasy. One
      night a crew from the schooner made a desperate attempt to board the
      lighter. On other nights they made other tries, and shots were exchanged
      before they were driven off.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when I was at the bottom of the hole I had bored and had just
      succeeded in fastening my hooks to a box, I got a shock that made me
      believe the end of the world had come. Something hit me on the top of the
      helmet with a thud that knocked me senseless for a moment. I reached out
      quickly with one hand, reserving the other for my hose, and felt the
      breastplate of a diver. I realized what had happened then. One of Keedy&rsquo;s
      men, sent to spy, had stumbled through the sand swirling from my pit, and
      had fallen in on me, not dreaming that I had been able to dig a
      fifteen-foot hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tangle that followed, it was a wonder that either of us escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way the man struggled I knew that he was terrified out of his
      senses. He clung to me desperately, as a drowning man might ding to a
      rescuer. Then he gave his emergency pull, and yanked me with him when he
      went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a raw temper which went with my raw surface in those terrible days.
      I left hose and box and went up with the caller, dragging my knife from my
      belt. I kept clashing the knife against the front bull&rsquo;s-eye of his
      helmet, and after we had been dragged together for some distance from the
      edge of the hole, and the sea became clearer, he perceived what I was
      doing. He let go his clutch, and it was well he did, for I was in a state
      of maniacal fury. I would have ripped his dress from crotch to neck-band
      with my knife if he had not escaped from me just as he did. I went back
      and recovered my hose, and after a time got the box. Then I returned to
      the lighter, for I was too unnerved to work any longer that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I lay on deck that afternoon, a shapeless, hideous thing of bruised and
      macerated flesh, I wondered whether I would be able to work any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was under the sea I was fairly beside myself with the excitement of
      the hunt. I could grind my teeth together and groan and fight my way
      through the sand, for there was gold at the bottom of the hole I was
      digging. And every time I went down through that fifteen feet of smother I
      knew that death raced me to the box of treasure and back. Under those
      circumstances, a man is desperate enough to forget his bloody cuts and raw
      skin. But I felt like a pretty weak and useless tool as I lay there on
      deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kama Holstrom was with me. She had insisted on becoming my nurse. I craved
      her companionship, I&rsquo;ll admit, but I wanted to hide myself from her eyes.
      Her father was in his state-room, busy at his job of adding more sheets of
      iron, more bands of steel, to the treasure-chest he had taken it upon
      himself to build. We could hear the bang of his hammer. Captain Holstrom
      worked days at that huge chest, slept on it nights with the key lashed
      into the palm of his right hand, and between whiles cuddled those ingots
      rapturously. In his way, he had become as insane over the matter as I was
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl and I were in the lee of the deck-house, to get out of the
      trades, and we did not see the boat when it came off Keedy&rsquo;s schooner. Had
      I seen it coming, Keedy would never have been allowed to board us. But all
      at once he appeared before the girl and myself. I felt a fierce impulse to
      get up and beat his face off him, even though my hands were as sore as the
      exposed nerve of an aching tooth. He got that flash from my eyes, and
      looked meek for a moment, but then he saw the condition I was in and
      became insolent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better listen to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on. I know your system. But I should
      say you&rsquo;re all in, Sidney. You need help. There&rsquo;s enough there for all of
      us. I&rsquo;ve got two good divers. I&rsquo;m over here to propose that we call the
      row off, and I&rsquo;ll send my men down to work with your contrivance and give
      you a rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That proposition from Marcena Keedy, after what he had done to us in the
      matter of that twenty thousand dollars, and after what he had tried to do
      to us in the affair of the customs men! I felt the language begin to roil
      in me as the said roiled under the force of my stream from the nozzle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Kama,&rdquo; I pleaded, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you please run away? I want to talk to this
      dirty dog. And send your father here with a club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not leave me. She came closer, and gave Keedy a look which would
      have wilted any other sort of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t afford to be foolish over what&rsquo;s past and gone,&rdquo; insisted my
      ex-partner. &ldquo;I left because you wasn&rsquo;t making good&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t holding up
      our end of the partnership. You fell down. Now if you can deliver goods
      we&rsquo;ll call off all trouble and start it over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Holstrom,&rdquo; I yelled, &ldquo;come here quick! Bring your hammer! Hurry!
      Knock that devil overboard!&rdquo; I shouted when the captain tore around the
      corner on the gallop. His eyes were bulged out, and he had his hammer over
      his head, for I guess he thought from the tone of my voice that pirates
      had boarded us. His expression did not soften any when he laid eyes on
      Keedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gambler put up a lean forefinger. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better hark to what I say,
      friend Rask.&rdquo; He went over the same talk he had had with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by a continental tin damsite!&rdquo; howled the captain. &ldquo;And how you have
      got the gall even to look the way of the <i>Zizania</i>, much more come
      aboard of her, is what gives me a callous over the collar-button. Get
      off&rsquo;m here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t dare to drive me, Holstrom, after I&rsquo;ve come to you with a fair
      and open proposition&mdash;ready to take the first step and let bygones
      rest. You can&rsquo;t afford any big talk! Why, you&rsquo;re only stealing this gold,
      whatever of it you are getting! This is pirate business&mdash;the whole of
      it. Now you be careful how you try to raise me out of the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That taunt about our rights there at San Apusa came from a rascal and a
      gambler, but the taunt made me think&mdash;and it stung, too. To tell the
      truth, I had done a little thinking about our rights in the matter of that
      treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re infernal thieves, and you can&rsquo;t make yourselves out anything
      else!&rdquo; Keedy insisted. &ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t afford to throw down another thief
      who is willing to come in and help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom shot out a swift kick and missed Keedy. He made a crack
      at him with the hammer, and missed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Keedy person had had experience with the captain, probably, in past
      times. He ran for the ladder and escaped into his boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are fools, besides being thieves,&rdquo; he informed us, standing up when
      he was a safe distance away, and shaking his fists. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand
      what I can do to you?&rdquo; Captain Holstrom returned the fist-shaking with too
      much alacrity to be misunderstood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; bellowed Keedy; &ldquo;have it your own way, you fools! I&rsquo;ll do you
      so good that you&rsquo;ll never know you were ever in the game.&rdquo; He was so mad
      that he let out a little more than he intended to, so I reckoned. &ldquo;There
      are men who will pay me more for what I can tell &rsquo;em than any
      rake-off you can give me, anyway.&rdquo; He was rowed away to his schooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means?&rdquo; I suggested, swapping looks with the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it means that he is going to blow this thing to the
      underwriters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we are stealing this gold, are we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom fingered his red knob of a nose, and looked away from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about law,&rdquo; I went on. &ldquo;I supposed you knew something
      about our rights in this thing&mdash;if we have any. I tell you, it&rsquo;s
      going to be pretty tough, Captain, if I&rsquo;ve been through all this hell only
      to have all our great hopes grabbed away from us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men have to take a chance in this world, Sidney. Damn the law in a case
      like this! The gold was there, and nobody was trying to get it. We had a
      right to try for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wasn&rsquo;t there any legal way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a drunken lawyer in San Francisco told me something about power by
      attorney, but it meant chasing around and getting hold of claims by
      shippers, or something of the kind&mdash;and that meant blowing our plans
      and letting a lot of grafters in on us. I simply cleared from the
      custom-house as a trawler and came away, minding my own business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now somebody else will take the job of minding it,&rdquo; I complained. I
      did not have much philosophy or courage about me just then. My hands and
      feet and shoulders were aching too miserably; and had all my suffering and
      daring been thrown away?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home, father,&rdquo; pleaded the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go home!&rdquo; he yelped. &ldquo;Sail in past the Golden Gate with this gold? Lug it
      back where coyote lawyers can get their whack at it until they&rsquo;ve trimmed
      us for every ounce? Well, I guess&mdash;not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wondered if he proposed to sail around in the middle of the Pacific
      Ocean, cuddling those ingots for amusement, the rest of his life; but I
      had neither strength nor taste for any more complaint or argument at that
      time. It was a mighty dismal outlook, according to my way of thinking. I
      saw that I was tied up with a man whose sole notion was to get the gold
      without bothering his head about how he was going to keep it. Later,
      Keedy&rsquo;s schooner frothed out past us, standing to sea, and headed north.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not go down again for almost a week. Courage is always a man&rsquo;s best
      asset, but courage in the job I had undertaken was pretty near my whole
      capital. And courage had left me&mdash;I had to admit it. I had been doing
      honest work with all a man&rsquo;s grit and strength and will. I had wrecked my
      body and wrenched my soul in effort. Yes, the work part of it was honest,
      but how about the honesty of our undertaking? I had got some plain words
      from Keedy&mdash;and I got no consolation from Captain Holstrom. I was
      daredevil enough and plenty in those days, but I was not the sort of a
      daredevil who would make a successful pirate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat on deck day after day, and bore with my agonies of body and wrestled
      with my soul. An idea had come to me as I had struggled with that problem
      of our rights. It was a rather vague idea. Of only one point of it was I
      sure&mdash;its success depended on getting as much of that gold as I could
      tear out of the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking upon it, hoping that good would come from it, brought my courage
      back to me. I was again ready to undergo tortures and to face death.

    <h2>
      XXXV&mdash;SUBMARINE PICKPOCKETS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> NEW arrival off
      San Apusa Bar had interested us for a couple of days. It was a husky sloop
      with a leg-of-mutton mainsail&mdash;a broad-bellied craft on which a dozen
      men showed themselves when it sailed past us to take up a position near
      the ribs of the wreck. This sloop seemed to be of a build to ride the
      surges easily, and ventured much closer inshore than we had dared to
      anchor our lighter. The men did not visit us, and displayed no desire to
      meddle with the secrets of the equipment on the walled-up scow. We
      wondered who they were, why they were there, and left them alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went down and crawfished my way over the sand windrows, but I could make
      only slow work of it, for I was stiffened by my days of inaction. But that
      new idea of mine went along with me for my encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had hardly put myself in position, ready to call for my stream of water,
      when I got a rousing surprise. Down through the sea came rushing a naked
      man. The depths were fairly clear, for I had not begun to stir the roil
      with my nozzle. His eyes were wide open and staring, and I reckon that I
      peered at him through my bull&rsquo;s-eye with eyes just as wide open. When he
      arrived close to me he dropped a rock from each hand, his diving weights,
      and grabbed me, hanging to my belt. I sat right there on the sand and
      gaped at him. His mouth was shut tight&mdash;he was holding his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time another naked man came down like the stick of a
      sky-rocket. He dropped his rocks and grabbed me, and the first man let go
      and went swimming up to the surface. Then came a third man and replaced
      the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to feel like a candidate for office in the receiving line. I
      wanted to ask some questions about what this function meant. But for good
      and obvious reasons I could not carry on a conversation, and I did not
      know the deaf-and-dumb alphabet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along came the fourth man. I noticed that each man wore a narrow belt with
      a huge knife fastened in it. And that&rsquo;s all the man did wear. The sight of
      the knife made me rather nervous. A man under water, straining to hold his
      breath, his eyes bulging with his efforts, is a savage-looking object at
      best. These men were plainly Mexicans, and they looked particularly
      savage. I felt pretty sure that they were not diving down there to cheer
      me in my loneliness or to ask me to run for mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it came to me all at once who these men were. As a submarine worker,
      I was interested, of course, in all sorts of jobs under the sea, and I had
      read various accounts of the Mexican pearl divers. I knew that they could
      descend long distances and could remain under water, many of them, for
      ninety seconds. One man succeeded another, diving in rotation. I remained
      there without moving, staring at them until I began to recognize faces.
      They were making me return visits. I realized that they did not propose to
      carve me&mdash;the first man could have done that on his first call.
      Therefore I got my nerve back and decided to go to work. I signaled for
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to me that my new friends might find that the &ldquo;fogo&rdquo; I stirred
      with that hose would be a little too much for them. I resisted an impulse
      to bat them away from me with that nozzle, a considerable effort in
      selfcontrol, for my temper was pretty short in those dreadful days.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stuck to me bravely at first when the sand began to swirl. There was
      an itching under my ribs when the sand made a pall and darkness settled on
      me. I was afraid that one of my callers might become peevish and ram his
      knife into me as a hint not to muddy that water.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not easy to hold my position and work with a man anchored to me.
      But I was not bothered for long.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tug at my belt ceased suddenly, and I knew that they had given up.
      They could not find me in that smother.
    </p>
    <p>
      They resumed operations again when I got up my first box. In working my
      way out of the hole I decreased the flow from the hose, and when I reached
      the top of the sand the swirling particles were settling and were being
      washed farther inshore by the surges. In a clearer sea down came those
      devils once more, and fastened to me, one by one, like leeches. They tried
      to clutch the box, but it was too heavy for them. It was hoisted past them
      up to the surf-boat, and once more I drove the nozzle into the sand and
      forced them off me with a whirlpool of mush.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were more bothersome the next time I allowed the sea to clear. Two
      dove at a time, and grabbed me, and almost lifted me up with them. I was
      furious, but I did not try to beat them off. I kept on about my own
      affairs as best I could, and allowed them to hang on to me. There were a
      dozen of them above, with knives, and I had no hankering to tackle the
      pack. I was not sure as to their motives, anyway. One rip of a knife would
      have put me out of business. But they did not offer to use knives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did a short day&rsquo;s work and went back to the lighter. Captain Holstrom
      had watched their diving operations and was full of eager questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night we doubled the guards on the <i>Zizania</i>. But no boat came
      near us.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friends were ready for me next day, and resumed the same tactics. I
      carried a bigger knife, and kept my eye out as best I could. But before I
      got the stream started they were coming at me three at a time. They kept
      lifting me off bottom, and I wasted a lot of valuable time and much of my
      little stock of strength before I got down on the sand and began to bore.
      They were ready for me again as soon as I got up with a box and the sea
      had cleared a bit. One of them brought a rope, and tried to get it around
      a box I was handling, but I had my tongs well set, and my men hoisted the
      treasure away from them. Then they began to interfere with me so savagely
      that I quit in disgust and signaled to be pulled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was half crazy with rage, and frantic because this sort of business was
      putting me where I could not realize on that idea which I was nursing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After listening to me, Captain Holstrom set his cap well down over his
      ears, jutting his chin, set his teeth, and called for his boat. He was
      rowed over to the side of the little sloop. He came back very soon and he
      was not looking pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get anything out of that bunch except a few grunts and a lot
      of jabber,&rdquo; he reported. &ldquo;They make believe they can&rsquo;t understand the
      English language. They want graft, I suppose. They&rsquo;d understand, all
      right, if I was to carry over a slug of gold and dump it over the rail.
      But I&rsquo;m about tired of feeding gold to everybody who comes along here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t our gold to give away to all comers,&rdquo; I told him. He blinked
      at me, and did not seem to understand. I did not go into that side of the
      question any further, for I was not ready for much argument at that time.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not stand for any more &lsquo;hot rocks,&rsquo;&rdquo; I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I, either,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;Begin to feed gold to those chaps, and
      they&rsquo;ll think we are scared of &rsquo;em and they&rsquo;ll want the whole
      mess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To show them that I was not scared, I went down the next day, and I had a
      wire edge on my temper. I balked at starting a knife duel, however, and
      after a struggle got my hole started.
    </p>
    <p>
      I struck something new that day in the ruck at the bottom of the hole. I
      found ingots loose in the hodgepodge of pantry wreckage. A wooden box had
      been smashed. I had a slit and a sort of deep pocket in the canvas
      overalls affair which protected my India-rubber suit. As my toes located
      loose ingots, I sifted the mush of sand with the fingers of one hand,
      captured the gold, and stuffed it down into the deep pocket. I came up
      with a box, and my breeches were bagging with gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the climax of my strained relations with those greaser divers.
      I&rsquo;ve heard of pickpockets operating everywhere, almost, but I reckon that
      I&rsquo;m the first and only man who ever had his pockets picked at the bottom
      of the sea. The first devil who got to me as the sand settled, in groping
      for a handhold on my dress, felt the loose ingots. He got one, but he did
      not get away with it. Trouble or no trouble, knives or no knives, I had
      got to the limit of my temper. I gave him a jab with the end of my
      sheet-iron nozzle, and as near as I could judge I took a hunk of meat out
      of him as neatly as a woman could operate on dough with a doughnut cutter.
      The edges of that nozzle had been whetted on sand until they were as sharp
      as a razor blade. The fellow drooped that ingot and darted upward, blood
      streaming behind him. Another diver was coming down to take his place, but
      when I jabbed at him with the nozzle he whirled like a fish and went up,
      giving me an awful kick when he started.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reckoned I had thrown down the gage of battle, and I was not minded to
      stay there and meet the pack, for I was weak after my extra struggle down
      in the hole. It had been a tedious job gathering that loose gold. I saw
      the box started on the way to the surf-boat, gave the emergency signal,
      and was yanked back to the lighter at a lively clip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later that day, being in a proper and ugly frame of mind, I tucked a rifle
      under my arm and had myself rowed to the neighboring sloop. I found the
      spokesman of the crew ready to talk English that day, all right. But when
      our conversation was ended I had received a surprise. No demand was made
      on me for a &ldquo;hot rock.&rdquo; I found that I was dealing with men who had deeper
      motives. It took me some time to understand that they were not holding out
      for a big offer. The man at the rail wrinkled his nose and sneered when I
      angrily told him that was what they were after.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d expect a gringo to tell me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we are not here
      to do business with thieves. You have no right to be here. You may pick
      and steal, but it will not amount to <i>that!</i>&rdquo; He snapped his finger
      above his head. &ldquo;We shall do our business with those who will have the
      gold in the end, with those who can pay and will pay. And we have a man
      who will see that we are paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My wits had been sharpened while I had toiled at San Apusa Bar. I was able
      to see farther into the ways of guile than before I had met a man like
      Marcena Keedy. I had a flash of suspicion that was almost instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think you have made a better trade with that renegade, Keedy, do
      you?&rdquo; I flung at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sure I had guessed right; the man&rsquo;s face betrayed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we are honest men&mdash;not thieves,&rdquo; he called back. &ldquo;We do not deal
      with thieves. We came here to stop you from stealing. But you do not stop.
      Now we shall see. We have kept our knives in our belts. But you have set
      us an example. You have tried to kill a man who did not offer to hurt
      you.&rdquo; He leaped up on the rail, and aimed a long finger at me. &ldquo;We can
      fight the way you do. If we catch you there on bottom again you&rsquo;ll be
      pulled up with six of these sticking in you.&rdquo; He patted the knife in his
      belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are men who can threaten and who cannot impress others. It is easily
      docketed as bluster. There is another kind of a man who gives you a look
      and a word, and you know that he means what he says. I went away from that
      sloop feeling that if I were desperate enough just then to commit suicide,
      an easy way had been opened for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went and tumbled into my berth, and viewed the ruins of that idea which
      I had been building so prayerfully. It looked to me then, in my
      despondency, as if Keedy was holding mighty good cards. If he had decided
      to turn informer, he could demand and would undoubtedly receive a noble
      rake-off. It was probable that he <i>would</i> inform&mdash;for that would
      be his natural, lazy method of making his money out of the thing. The
      posting of the pearl divers in behalf of the underwriters would be an
      additional feather in his cap; on the other hand, if he proposed to come
      with a backer and new equipment&mdash;having discovered my system&mdash;he
      had good reasons for leaving men behind him who would hold us in check. If
      Keedy returned with steam-pumps he could rip the bottom out of the
      Pacific. Our makeshift equipment would not be two-spot high.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how soon could he return, whether he came piloting the underwriters or
      came on his own hook as a rival &ldquo;thief&rdquo;? I talked with Captain Holstrom on
      that matter the next day. He rubbed his nose and scruffed his hair, and
      could not guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked the captain for his estimate of the amount of treasure in our
      chest. He told me that we had rising three-quarters of a million.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain, it has become a matter of touch and go&mdash;live or die&mdash;with
      us. With less than a third of that gold in our hands, we&rsquo;re in no position
      to do business when the pinch comes. I&rsquo;m going after the rest of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said you knew them greaser pickerel would poke their knives into
      you. God knows I&rsquo;m hungry for the rest of the treasure, Sidney, but I&rsquo;m no
      Marcena Keedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down at night, Captain Holstrom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>can</i> be done. After I get my stream started I&rsquo;m in the dark even
      when the sun is brightest. I know the way from the lighter to that wreck,
      all right. I&rsquo;ve dragged my way there times enough with a trail of blood
      behind me,&rdquo; I told him, sourly. &ldquo;It can never be any worse than it has
      been. We&rsquo;ll take extra chances, moor the lighter nearer the wreck, get rid
      of the surf-boat and crew, and leave those greasers guessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I want to say, to the credit of the captain, that he opposed this
      undertaking of mine. His daughter&mdash;But I will not dwell on that
      point. It harrows my soul now to remember the manner in which I opposed my
      obstinate and reckless will to her honest grief and her almost frantic
      protests.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went down that night. I gave &rsquo;em three boxes before midnight. I
      ate a lunch, and gave &rsquo;em one box more before I quit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no ambition to make this story a rival of Fox&rsquo;s Book of Martyrs. I
      have already given some idea of the physical state I was in. I think I
      became numb to pain, accustomed to agonies. I cannot explain otherwise how
      I ever kept on, night after night. I haven&rsquo;t the courage to write down
      what I suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But out from under those grinning greasers&mdash;grinning their sneers at
      us daytimes&mdash;I dragged one and one-half million dollars&rsquo; worth of
      gold ingots inside of two weeks&mdash;and they never suspected that I was
      under water.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last of that nightmare, I felt as if I were working with my
      chin over my shoulder. I was looking for trouble. I was expecting
      disaster. I was scared to the marrow. I am not referring to any feelings I
      had on account of the pearl divers. Their bug eyes had never detected me
      in what I was about. I knew that darkness protected me more surely from
      any attack by them than iron walls would have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I worked nights with the constant feeling that the red and green eyes
      of a steamer were coming up over the horizon. When I was awake daytimes I
      peered into the northern sky hour after hour, expecting and dreading to
      see the trail of smoke which would announce the coming of Marcena Keedy
      and those whom he had notified.
    </p>
    <p>
      My conferences with Captain Holstrom had been scant and rather brusque.
      There were some points in that idea of mine that I had not thought out to
      my own satisfaction, and I had not found the captain to be especially
      helpful in attacking problems. He was wholly taken up in helping to pull
      that gold in over the rail, in storing it, in guarding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His daughter knew why I stared at the northern horizon, and why desperate
      worry added to the other woes I was suffering in that tophet of toil. She
      had resigned herself to the situation when I had persisted in keeping on.
      She became, as before, my wistful nurse. She talked to me as she would
      have soothed a madman whom she hoped to win back to sanity. Well, I was a
      lunatic in those days&mdash;there&rsquo;s not much doubt of it. It was madness
      made up of fear, desperation, agony of physical pain, lust for gold&mdash;all
      forcing me to do work which no sane man could have accomplished in my
      condition of body.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dared to break her usual silence on the matter of the treasure when we
      were on deck one afternoon after my sleep. She had been gazing at me
      sorrowfully while I stared into the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what use is it&mdash;this dreadful work and worry? You have told me
      that you feel like a thief in it all. You sit and stare into the north as
      though you were a wicked man, instead of being so brave and successful in
      the most wonderful work a man ever did. You are getting their gold for
      them. But you feel that they are coming to take it all away&mdash;and call
      you a thief. You cannot deceive me as to your thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had to acknowledge to myself that her woman&rsquo;s intuition was in fine
      working order. I understood what men were, naturally, in affairs where big
      sums of money were involved. These men, provided Keedy had done as I
      supposed he had, would have Keedy&rsquo;s lies about us to inflame them still
      further in addition to their natural greed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was no quitter on one point. She clenched her little fists and
      kept on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say fight back! It may be their money&mdash;somebody&rsquo;s money&mdash;but
      what good did it do them or anybody else until you came here with your
      strength and your courage and your brains and got it up from the bottom of
      the ocean? I don&rsquo;t know what the law is about such things&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      care. I&rsquo;ve heard you and father talk, but I only know that often in this
      life law is one thing and justice is another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are the laws of salvage,&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;We could turn this money
      over and wait for the courts to decide. But I&rsquo;m afraid of what may happen
      if we do that. There&rsquo;s that renegade Keedy with his lies; there are the
      customs men of Mexico, and all that mess of international law to
      complicate things. Keedy can claim partnership; the shippers can claim
      shares, I suppose; this one and that one can dip in their fingers; and
      lawyers can tie the matter up; and God only knows when it will all be
      untied so that we can get what we have honestly earned. We may have to
      fight for our liberty, for men are crazy enough to try to make us out
      thieves, providing they can get hold of much money by lies and injustice.
      I have been pounding it all out in my poor head, and I can&rsquo;t seem to
      believe that the law is going to give us what we ought to have. For, you
      see, this thing isn&rsquo;t like anything else that has ever happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say fight!&rdquo; she insisted, her eyes alight, her cheeks flaming under the
      tan. &ldquo;You have fought the ocean for their sakes as well as your own&mdash;and
      you have won. Keep on fighting! Plan something, do something&mdash;get
      into some position where they will have to come to you and beg for what&rsquo;s
      theirs. You have earned the right to make them beg. And you know you
      have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I did know it; and on that belief I had based my idea which had
      served for my encouragement. Her advice and her woman&rsquo;s spirit in the
      matter heartened me. She had acted like the lady of the castle of whom I
      had read. She brought to me my helmet and shield, and was sending me out
      to battle as a brave woman should. I started to tell her more about my
      idea&mdash;but we were interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a queer noise in the direction of the ladder which led to the
      lower deck. It was such a prodigious puffing and wheezing and grunting
      that anybody might suppose that we were going to receive a visit from a
      hippopotamus. The Snohomish Glutton, the cook of the <i>Zizania</i>,
      appeared to us. I had not laid eyes on that individual for weeks. He stuck
      in his pantry like a hermit in a cell, reveling in the steam of food,
      stuffing himself even while he was cooking for others. He rolled rather
      than walked across the deck, and stood before us, propping up the rolls of
      fat which shuttered his little eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how much there is or where you&rsquo;re keeping it,&rdquo; he blurted,
      without preface, in his tin-whistle voice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask questions&mdash;I
      stay in my pantry and mind my business. But I serve the niggers in the
      port alley and the whites in the starboard alley, and I hear both sides.
      But there&rsquo;s only one side now. They said that the monkey&rsquo;s tail started
      the row. But they&rsquo;ve forgotten the row. Gold will make men forget &rsquo;most
      anything. They&rsquo;ve got together at last. They are going to grab for it.
      They thought I haven&rsquo;t been hearing because my eyes were shut and I seemed
      to be asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, my man?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that you can play checkers on that checkerboard crew now, sir. It
      has settled into a solid board&mdash;white and black mixed. The Russian
      Finn is captain. He killed my cat. I have said I would get even with him.
      He is captain, and they are going to drop on to that gold and run away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have planned a mutiny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mutiny and all the side dishes that go with it. I have heard. I wasn&rsquo;t
      asleep when they thought I was. I&rsquo;ve got to go back. I have duff in the
      pot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He backed to the ladder and let himself down, rung by rung, grunting more
      terrifically than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl leaped to her feet. She held her clenched fists above her head.
      Her white teeth showed beneath the crimson of her parted lips. She drove
      her hands down at her sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she had gasped, when her hands were above her head. When she drove
      them down her woman&rsquo;s soul spoke its anger and horror. &ldquo;Damn the name of
      gold!&rdquo; she cried; and I would not have indorsed a milder phrase even from
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For weeks my head had been full of seething particles of schemes relating
      to my central idea. I reckon it needed a shock&mdash;needed the desperate
      occasion of instant action&mdash;to make those particles cohere into
      resolve. For a moment I was stunned by the prospect of this new danger;
      and then a course of action came to me in a flash of inspiration&mdash;it
      was the result of all the thinking I had been doing, without making up my
      mind to act.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hobbled to find Captain Holstrom in his state-room. I had to push him
      back when he had heard a dozen words of what I had reported. He had
      grabbed his pistols and was rushing to kill off a few prospective
      mutineers as an example to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have got to do what I advise in this matter, Captain. I&rsquo;ve been
      making plans. We&rsquo;ve got not only this crew to consider, but Keedy and
      those he is bringing down here. He is coming. We may as well make up our
      minds to that. I want you to go down on the main deck as quickly as you
      can and order the crew to get out planks and start in making strong boxes.
      Privately, you and I will overhaul the junk for scrap iron, for chains and
      cable. Get after the men. Hustle them. Make it a hurry-up job. Busy men
      won&rsquo;t have time to talk mutiny. And say to one of the mates, when you are
      giving off orders, that you are going to pack the treasure into boxes
      suitable for handling. Say that loud enough so that all the men will
      hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be joheifered if I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve got to handle a lunatic as
      well as a mutiny,&rdquo; flamed Captain Holstrom. &ldquo;Are you advising me to pack
      up that gold so that it will be easy lugging for the crew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as they believe that it is going to be packed so as to be easy
      lugging there&rsquo;ll be no mutiny until those boxes have been made. You&rsquo;ve got
      to do as I say. You ought to have had your lesson by this time that I know
      what I&rsquo;m talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shuttled his eyes when I looked at him. He was remembering those past
      matters in which he had made a fool of himself in resisting me. I was
      willing to explain my plan to him, for I was not trying to humiliate
      Captain Holstrom. But just then I had a feeling that every moment counted.
      One instant more and I knew what the pricking of my mental thumbs had
      meant. Mate Number-two Jones came clattering along the deck from below. He
      shoved a red and greatly troubled face in at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get your guns, Cap&rsquo;n Holstrom,&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re grumbling and
      mumbling. It means mutiny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your guns with you, if you like,&rdquo; I told the captain. &ldquo;But go down
      there as cool as you can. Give off your orders as if you didn&rsquo;t notice
      anything. And be sure to throw out that hint about why you want the boxes
      made. This is no time to bull this game of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom was no fool, and he knew when a man was in dead earnest.
      I pushed him and he went. I&rsquo;ll have to confess that he qualified as a good
      actor when he arrived on the main deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was looking down from the bridge, and I saw the men of the crew exchange
      winks and grins behind the captain&rsquo;s back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The model crew of the crack ship in all the world could not have shown
      such willing obedience. They went to their work on the rush. Saws rasped
      and hammers banged. There was clattering of iron and hum of industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom left the work in charge of his mates, and came back to
      his state-room to resume his watch over the treasure. I closeted myself
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;ll get down to the bed-rock of the proposition, Captain Holstrom.
      We have agreed&mdash;you and I&mdash;that Keedy is about due here. We
      don&rsquo;t know who will come with him. But we can be mighty sure that they&rsquo;ll
      be no friends of ours. We&rsquo;d be playing the parts of idiots to keep that
      gold on board the <i>Zizania</i>. But there isn&rsquo;t a harbor nearer than
      Acapulco where we can land it; we can&rsquo;t lug it ashore on the open coast
      through the breakers; we can&rsquo;t dodge all around the Pacific Ocean with it.
      Right now, there&rsquo;s another complication besides Keedy and his crowd. We
      have still more desperate thieves right here with us. The mates and Shank
      are safe. To-night the five of us will get busy, pack that gold in the
      strong boxes, and drop it overboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great guns!&rdquo; groaned the captain. &ldquo;I said you was crazy, and now I&rsquo;m sure
      of it. Dig it all up, and then throw it away again! No, let&rsquo;s not put it
      in the boxes. Let&rsquo;s hoot and holler and cavort around the deck and heave
      it overboard, one ingot at a time, so as to see who can make the biggest
      splash. Come on&mdash;let&rsquo;s have fun!&rdquo; he raved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am far from being crazy, Captain Holstrom,&rdquo; I informed him, giving him
      the hard eye so steadily that he blinked. &ldquo;To each box we&rsquo;ll hitch chain
      long enough to reach to the surface. That chain will have rope cable&mdash;say
      ten feet of it&mdash;hitched to the end, and the rope will be buoyed to a
      small spar. The box and all the chain will lie on bottom. The small spar
      with its rope cable will swim well under the surface of the water. In case
      we want to raise the box we can catch the rope and spar with a rake, or
      else drag for it with a chain between two boats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate to see that gold go under water again,&rdquo; mourned Captain Holstrom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that or stand by and see mutineers lug it off or lawyers divide it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He writhed like a speared fish when he pondered on the alternatives. I
      went out on deck and left him to think, confident that his slow mind would
      finally swing to my way of making the best of a bad matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The checker-board crew was at work in a real frenzy of effort. I have no
      doubt that each man secretly told himself that he was building his own box&mdash;and
      he was putting his best work into his treasure-carrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer evening was long and the crew labored on after their supper.
      According to my best judgment, when darkness shut down on their labors
      there were boxes enough for our purpose. The men went to their rest on the
      berth-deck in the forepeak of the steamer. Captain Holstrom had remarked,
      casually, in their hearing, that he would wait till next day before
      packing the ingots. From my post on the bridge, though the dusk had
      deepened, I caught a cheerful wink or two between man and man, and they
      went below looking like cats who had been promised a full meal of
      canaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to encourage general peace and confidence, the mates allowed the
      usual deck watch to go below and sleep, and the lazy sailors were only too
      glad to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were snoring in satisfactory chorus, Captain Holstrom slid their
      hatch over and barred it so as to guard against a surprise by peepers.
      Before two bells after midnight the last box of our gold had gone gurgling
      down over the taffrail. The last spar winked out of sight under the surge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; groaned Captain Holstrom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, it has!&rdquo; said I, and felt the girl&rsquo;s little hand snuggle
      comfortingly into my unsightly fist.

      XXXVI&mdash;THE TERROR FROM THE NORTH
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE next morning
      Captain Holstrom ordered the checker-board crew assembled on the main
      deck, forward. He appeared on the bridge and leaned over the rail like a
      candidate ready to make a stump speech. But, unlike a candidate, he had
      two revolvers strapped to his waist and in plain sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a few words to say to you critters down there,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I know
      all about what you have been planning to do. I have watched you peeking
      and spying around this morning for them boxes. Well, you won&rsquo;t find them.
      Them boxes are a good way off.&rdquo; He pointed a stubby finger down at the
      Russian Finn. &ldquo;You come up here!&rdquo; he commanded. The Finn turned pale and
      shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come up here and I&rsquo;ll promise that you won&rsquo;t be hurt. I want you to
      take back a report to that gang of yours. If you don&rsquo;t obey a master&rsquo;s
      orders and come up here,&rdquo; continued the captain, pulling a gun, &ldquo;it will
      be mutiny&mdash;and I know how to deal with mutiny. I&rsquo;ll shoot you where
      you stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a little hesitation the Finn climbed the ladder. The captain led him
      into the wheel-house, into all the state-rooms, and took him on a genera!
      tour of inspection of the upper deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you can see with your own eyes that there isn&rsquo;t any gold up here to
      mutiny about. You go back and tell that gang what you have seen&mdash;or,
      rather, what you didn&rsquo;t see.&rdquo; He pushed the Finn to the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you all liberty to hunt over the lower part of the steamer from
      forepeak to rudder,&rdquo; declared the captain over the rail. &ldquo;You can help
      yourselves to all the gold you find. But I can tell you that there ain&rsquo;t
      an ounce aboard here. That gold is stored where you can&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo; He
      swept his hand in a gesture which embraced the horizon. &ldquo;If you act like
      men from now on until this cruise is over, you&rsquo;ll be paid like lords. If
      you hanker for mutiny, start in and mutiny. Them who live through it will
      never get a cent; them who are killed can&rsquo;t use gold where they will fetch
      up; it will be too hot to handle!&rdquo; The men fell to muttering among
      themselves, but I could see that they had been cowed. The report of the
      leader made them still more melancholy. They divided at last&mdash;the
      blacks from the whites&mdash;and went about their tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to say, Sidney, that you showed good judgment,&rdquo; said the captain,
      as he went to his state-room. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t feel like giving three cheers&mdash;not
      while that gold is back on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, there was gold to the value of about a million yonder on the bottom
      in that wreck of the <i>Golden Gate</i>, but I had no appetite for more
      gold just then. I knew that I had reached the limit of my strength and
      courage. I had won more than two millions from the greed of that miserly
      ocean, and had given it back again in order to make another fight against
      the greed of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat on deck and endured the pains of my tortured body, and waited for
      the inevitable when it should come down over the horizon from the north.
      Half a dozen anxious days dragged past&mdash;and then it came!
    </p>
    <p>
      A trail of blacksmoke signaled it&mdash;they were using lots of coal and
      were in a hurry, as that banner of black indicated. Framed in Captain
      Holstrom&rsquo;s long telescope, it took form as a big ocean tug. She seemed to
      leap angrily across the sea as the surges rolled under her, and the bows
      churned up white yeast.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no hesitation in the manner in which she came on. She bore down
      on us with a speed which seemed to say, &ldquo;Here we come to take our own!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We counted at least a score of men aboard, using our glass. And when the
      tug slowed off our quarter we saw that most of the men held rifles in the
      hook of their arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I have been expecting,&rdquo; I told the captain. &ldquo;They have come
      down here proposing to treat us as pirates. How would you feel right now
      with gold aboard here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom wagged his head mournfully, and seemed to lack words with
      which to express his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going to make fast to you,&rdquo; bawled a man, with a voice like a
      fog-horn. &ldquo;Mind how you perform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was a reckless performance even for a tug in that sea, but they
      rigged a row of fenders and put her alongside with much clanging of bell.
      A dozen men leaped on board the <i>Zizania</i>. Some were guards who
      carried rifles. There were three men who seemed of importance. I spied
      Marcena Keedy on the upper deck of the tug, holding to the funnel stays.
      He did not venture to come on board us with the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them do the talking,&rdquo; I whispered to Captain Holstrom as the three
      were climbing the ladder. &ldquo;Just stand on your dignity as master of this
      steamer.&rdquo; And the captain did so in a way that highly satisfied me. He
      chewed a toothpick and displayed much indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bid you welcome, gents!&rdquo; he informed them, stiffly. &ldquo;And you can see
      that I ain&rsquo;t looking for trouble&mdash;otherwise I might have a few words
      to say about your way of boarding this steamer. If it&rsquo;s ignorance of rules
      and etiquette, I&rsquo;ll overlook it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s business, Captain Holstrom,&rdquo; snapped the spokesman, a chap who wore
      a hard hat and looked as though he had just closed a desk in an office.
      &ldquo;We are from San Francisco, and represent the underwriters in the matter
      of the <i>Golden Gate</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step into the wheel-house&mdash;it&rsquo;s my office,&rdquo; stated the captain. He
      pointed to the muzzle of the first rifle, rising over the edge of the
      upper deck. &ldquo;If those fellows come up here I shall consider it an insult
      to me as a peaceful man and master of this vessel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re no pirates,&rdquo; remarked Captain Holstrom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man gave orders to the gunmen to remain below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are not pirates,&rdquo; he said, when we were assembled in the
      wheel-house, &ldquo;you can show it by turning over to us the gold you&rsquo;ve dug
      out of the wreck over yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The spokesman was a rather excitable fellow. He began to tap his finger on
      the captain&rsquo;s breast. He showed documents with seals and all the other
      law-shark trimmings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right to come here and operate. Have you got attorney&rsquo;s
      powers? Have you got anything in the way of permits? No, you haven&rsquo;t. That
      gold belongs to other people. Give it up and save trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Holstrom threw a sort of helpless look at me, stifling some
      emotion. I realized that he was at the end of his dignity and that in
      about ten seconds he would begin to use his talents in the line of
      profanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me if I say a word here,&rdquo; I broke in. &ldquo;I am a partner in this
      enterprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re using a polite word for this kind of a job,&rdquo; sneered the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may represent the underwriters,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but to all intents and
      purposes the underwriters had abandoned the treasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall take our gold, my friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rights or no rights?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made it a grab game, and we&rsquo;re in on the grab!&rdquo; He was mighty
      overbearing and offensive. Law was behind him, a fortune was concerned,
      and he was showing the usual spirit of the greedy world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have full powers in this matter so far as the underwriters are
      concerned, have you?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolute.&rdquo; He waved his papers under my nose. &ldquo;Issued due and regular by
      the court and the United States.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you realize that you are not in the United States, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s got to be more or less dog eat dog in this game. We happen to
      have the cards. If you don&rsquo;t hand over that gold, we shall put a crew on
      board this steamer, guard it with rifles, and set this boat into waters
      where we have jurisdiction. I&rsquo;ll be frank to say that then we can beat you
      in court in the lying game, because we start with law behind us, and
      you&rsquo;re handicapped. I say this to show you that you&rsquo;d better fork over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was holding my temper. For the sake of my own conscience in this affair,
      I wanted the other side to lay all their cards on the table; in their
      insolence and confidence, they seemed inclined to do so, for their plain
      intent was to intimidate us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do we get out of it for ourselves?&rdquo; I inquired, meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember that you came down here on the sly, thinking you were going to
      get away with the whole thing. It hasn&rsquo;t been your fault that you haven&rsquo;t.
      I think that we can promise to keep you out of the penitentiary if you act
      sensible. I&rsquo;m not making any rash promises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There we had it! Contemptuous disregard of all our rights because they
      thought they had the upper hand on us!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have hinted before this that men become monsters in the presence of much
      gold. From my own experience I knew the insanity which gold stirs in a
      man. I had foreseen some such attitude as this on the part of the men who
      would come to claim the treasure. A grab game, eh? And success to the best
      man!
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at that fellow&mdash;at his white hands and his flabbiness&mdash;a
      man who had never done an honest day&rsquo;s labor with grit and muscles. He had
      given me his code. I told him as much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I thank you for giving me that code,&rdquo; I went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stripped the bandages off my hands. I tore the wrappings off my feet. I
      showed them sights which made their faces turn white. I ripped the shirt
      from my back and exhibited that spectacle of ragged flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have given me your code, I say! It&rsquo;s going to be a grab game. All
      right! Have it your way. Go hunt this steamer from top to bottom. You&rsquo;re
      welcome! Prove that we have any of your damned gold! Go ahead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hobbled out of the wheel-house and went into my state-room, and they
      began to hunt the <i>Zizania</i> over. And I heard what Captain Holstrom
      said to them after they had finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, gents, you have made sure that there&rsquo;s nothing on my <i>Zizania</i>
      that belongs to you. You&rsquo;re aboard here without any rights. I just want to
      remark that I&rsquo;ll give you five minutes to get aboard your own boat and
      cast off, and stay cast off&rsquo;m here, yourselves. I&rsquo;ve got some men who can
      fight&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve got a two-pounder in my junk-heap. I&rsquo;ll put a ball
      through that tug that will disturb her innards seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went silently and grudgingly&mdash;but they went. I enjoyed the
      expression on Marcena Keedy&rsquo;s face as the tug backed off. I came out on
      the upper deck and gloated down on him. They anchored their craft a little
      distance from us, and I could readily imagine the council of war that
      started among them as soon as their mud-hook bit the holding-ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      A boat put off from the tug next day, and the three important-looking men
      were in it. But Captain Holstrom warned them away from us. The spokesman
      shouted his message. He was angry, and he still dealt in threats. In order
      to impress upon those gentlemen that we were not at all interested in
      their threats, the captain and I turned our backs on them, and after a
      time they bawled themselves out of breath and returned to the tug.
    </p>
    <p>
      They kept up those tactics for most of a week. They were certainly
      stubborn and insolent persons, and they were fighting for big money. But
      the more they raved and threatened, the more at peace with myself and my
      conscience I felt. We were fighting for our own now, and they had
      established the code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then at last the boat came with a white flag. The spokesman politely
      stated that they had come to talk some business in private, and begged to
      be allowed to come on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Kama was with me on deck when they climbed up the ladder. She had
      resumed her woman&rsquo;s garb, and they stared at her in frank astonishment and
      admiration. She did look particularly sweet, her little cap on her curls,
      her sweater displaying her winsome curves of beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to astonish them, I say. The next moment she astonished <i>me</i>.
      She walked into the wheel-house by my side, and was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; she said to the three, &ldquo;you have seen with your own eyes how
      this poor boy has suffered. You can&rsquo;t see how I have suffered as I have
      watched him do what he has done, but the marks are on my soul, I know.
      There is law in the world, and all that, and men are too apt to get angry
      in law when there is much money concerned. Can&rsquo;t you all keep from being
      angry to-day, and be wise, and decide on what is right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at one another and the spokesman stammered something about
      being over there to have a heart-to-heart talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I not stay?&rdquo; she asked, wistfully. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say a word to bother you&mdash;I
      won&rsquo;t move unless you start to quarrel&mdash;and then I&rsquo;ll only remind you
      that there&rsquo;s a lady present.&rdquo; The queer little smile she gave them started
      the grins on their faces. The ice was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those men were human once more. The girl had given the magic touch to the
      conference.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had not been getting anywhere at all, in the past, and we woke up and
      realized it as we stood there with the girl&rsquo;s presence toning us down. It
      had been man&rsquo;s bluff and bluster; they had arrived ready mad and I felt
      that I knew what ailed them outside of the mere money part of the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Marcena Keedy&rsquo;s tongue you
      would have shown a better side to us when you arrived here.&rdquo; Nobody seemed
      ready to say anything for a moment and I went on. &ldquo;I reckon he told, you
      that he was our partner and that we have cheated him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had quite a story to tell when he reported the matter to the
      underwriters,&rdquo; admitted the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After you sized him up, you naturally decided that men who could cheat
      Keedy must be the champion renegades of the Pacific coast! I can&rsquo;t blame
      you much for the way you came banging up against us. I don&rsquo;t know what
      else he has said to our prejudice, and I don&rsquo;t care. Now that you are here
      with us, face to face, and we&rsquo;re down on a real man-basis, we don&rsquo;t need
      to paw over what a liar has said. I want you to call that man Keedy on to
      the <i>Zizania</i>, even though he poisons the air. What I have to say
      I&rsquo;ll say in his hearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m pretty sure that Keedy did not relish making that call, but the men
      who went after him brought him. He had a gambler&rsquo;s face and nerve and he
      put on his best front; he even disregarded Miss Kama&rsquo;s presence and
      lighted a cigar to appear more at ease, and I plucked it from between his
      jaws and flung it out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want the floor for only a few moments, gentlemen,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told the group. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you how this expedition was
      organized, how this person Keedy fitted in; and what happened.&rdquo; And I did
      tell them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was necessary for the lawyer to appoint Capt. Rask Holstrom as special
      guard to keep Keedy&rsquo;s mouth shut while I talked, but the rules of a
      court-room prevailed after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit, gentlemen,&rdquo; I said when I had finished my little story, &ldquo;that
      we have acted like children so far as the legal side of this thing goes.
      But it seemed only a crazy scheme at best when we started out&mdash;I
      couldn&rsquo;t feel that I was dealing with any reality. After we arrived here
      we did the best we could, and we have been too busy to study up law. But I
      want to say that Captain Holstrom and I are not thieves by nature. I&rsquo;ll
      show you a thief, however. There he stands!&rdquo; I pointed to Keedy. &ldquo;He stole
      from us a box of bullion worth twenty thousand dollars. I know that he
      recovered two more boxes. Now that you are proposing to handle this matter
      man-fashion, Captain Holstrom and I stand ready to give to owners what is
      fairly their own. I advise you to ask Keedy what he proposes to do!&rdquo; The
      lawyer asked him in mighty prompt fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to date nobody seems to be making any showdown except in talk,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Keedy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cash in conversation just as far as anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how does it happen, Keedy, that when you gave us your other
      information you did not say that you had any of the gold in your hands?&rdquo;
       asked the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He scowled and did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If these men turn their bullion over on a square lay, are you prepared to
      do the same?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk business after I have seen them turn it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a rather queer attitude for you to take, Keedy, after your talk to
      the underwriters and to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the renegade did not show any inclination to come across with anything
      definite.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew well enough that he could not. His try with those divers had cost
      high and it was safe to presume that he had realized on every ounce of the
      bullion his men had recovered and had planted the money. My rancor was
      deep and I walked up to him and declared my belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand, Keedy, that you must produce the bullion or its value in
      money or our bargain doesn&rsquo;t stand,&rdquo; said the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not need that declaration to be assured that the villain had sold us
      without regard to our rights or our safety. And sudden fervor and
      determination thrilled through and through me. I proposed to show those
      men from San Francisco the difference between Marcena Keedy and the
      partners on whom he had pasted his dirty label. Mere talk was not as
      convincing proof as I desired. I had already made an investment of my best
      strength and all my courage and I had much to show. But I felt that if
      those men could see with their own eyes what that investment signified in
      the way of human endurance, they would meet me in more generous spirit
      when we came to make our bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to then the legal papers had only been waved under my nose in
      threatening manner. I asked permission to examine them, and the lawyer was
      very obliging. They were all-embracing, even to granting powers of
      attorney to the underwriters&rsquo; agents to handle the matter in all its
      aspects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down after the rest of that gold, and
      every box will be put into your hands as it comes up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I got a glimpse at the girl&rsquo;s face, but I did not dare to look into her
      eyes. Her cheeks were white, and she was gasping protests which nobody
      heeded, for those men were listening to something which filled their ears
      just then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after you see how I am bucking hell for your sakes, well, then we
      shall see what you have to say to me&mdash;man to man!&rdquo;

      produced a wrong impression. I was playing a big game and I was using all
      the hard, cold and calculating wit I possessed. As I have said, I proposed
      to operate on human nature. After all, I was in no position to demand
      anything from those men, in spite of the bluff we were making in regard to
      the treasure we had recovered and concealed. I had a healthy fear of what
      the courts might do to us in a case where stolen property had been hidden.
      It was up to me to cultivate a spirit of generosity in them&mdash;and that
      was why I went down again, though every nerve and fiber in my racked body
      made protest. But I went down under better conditions.

    <p>
      The tug had powerful pumps and a considerable quantity of good hose. She
      was manageable in shoal water, and by means of her hawsers and well-set
      kedges we were able to swing her in, for the day&rsquo;s work, fairly close to
      the wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no need of further dwelling on details&mdash;and it would be
      necessary to supply the details by somebody&rsquo;s word of mouth&mdash;somebody
      who watched me, for I don&rsquo;t remember much of what happened. I was a
      lunatic, I suppose; my human machinery was operated by a single mania. As
      I look back I am unable to separate the nightmare from the reality with
      any amount of clarity. Therefore, we&rsquo;ll allow all that to hang in limbo,
      seeing that this is a plain yam and not a study of psychology.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I can remember flashes through the dark curtain, and of a few of
      these I will make mention, for they have a bearing on the tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a period when I was in the mood for babbling. I could feel my
      dry tongue clacking away inside my jaws like a clapper in a wooden box and
      wholly beyond my control. That tongue was telling all my story about my
      love and longing and ambition in my boyhood days&mdash;telling the story
      to somebody who patted my cheek and crooned sympathy&mdash;somebody who
      did not annoy me by dispute when I said that I would never live to see
      Levant again&mdash;somebody who promised to carry there the three rings
      and tell my story and fulfil my requests. It was a dream full of agony for
      me&mdash;rather it may be called a dreaming reality. I wanted to stop that
      clacking tongue. I wasn&rsquo;t operating it. It was telling a lot of truth
      which I did not want published. It was putting me in wrong, I felt, just
      as if some enemy were tattling about me. It was mine and I hated it
      furiously for what seemed to be betrayal of me. I wasn&rsquo;t standing for what
      the tongue said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a period when I forgave the tongue many of its past
      offenses, because, at last, it did good service for me in man-talk to men.
      It was steady and convincing and I was conscious that it had helped me to
      win in some big matter. Then, later, there was a time when there were
      shots and shoutings and dismal trouble of some sort. And, last of all, in
      the blurred imaginings, mixed with the real, came the long-drawn-out,
      misty, groping, wondering consciousness that I was out of strife and
      trouble and agony. But I could not come out of the shadow&mdash;I knew
      that many days and nights came and went while I was trying to grasp
      something which I could know was reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was dreaming that I was back in my old room in Dodovah Vose&rsquo;s tavern,
      and that dream seemed to last for days. Then all at once I woke up and I
      was truly in that room.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the open window sat Capt. Rask Holstrom and he was junking up a Red
      Astrachan apple with his jackknife. He poised a cube of the fruit on the
      tip of the blade; looked me square in the eyes, and asked, in a
      matter-of-fact way, if I was feeling more like myself that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt about my being in Dodovah Vose&rsquo;s tavern! I made sure
      before I opened my mouth. There was the old quaint smell of the place, and
      I could always trust my nose. For my ears there was the whining squeak of
      the windmill pump in the stable-yard. I touched the irregular seams of the
      silk crazy-quilt, and, to delight my eyes, the brass handles of the
      ancient high-boy in the corner blinked back the radiance of the afternoon
      sunlight. All my senses were satisfied, for I could almost taste, as the
      breeze flicked my lips, the savor of fried chicken which came floating in
      through the window. And after my senses told me what they did, I felt at
      ease and dismissed all the shadows and imaginings. Never did a man come
      back to his right balance of mind in more commonplace fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to be just as matter-of-fact as Captain Rask. I told him I felt
      pretty fair. Parts of my hands were bandaged and I was aware that my feet
      were tied up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have another apple?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I had been eating apples from Dodovah Vose&rsquo;s orchard! I used to steal
      from his trees&mdash;especially the early-autumn fruit. I must have been
      giving the impression that I was pretty nigh all right, even though the
      kink in my brain had kept me on the side-track so far as I was concerned,
      personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain junked an apple into quarters, pared them, and gave me the
      fruit. I think Eve tempted Adam with a Red Astrachan!
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain sat and rocked and munched. Confound his old pelt, why didn&rsquo;t
      he start in and tell me what had happened?
    </p>
    <p>
      He clacked his knife shut after a time and yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, as I was telling you before you had your nap, Kama and I may as well
      move on. There isn&rsquo;t much more that&rsquo;s sensible we can do for you.&rdquo; I
      wondered just what they <i>had</i> done!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Kama?&rdquo; I called her &ldquo;Kama&rdquo; quite naturally; it seemed to me that
      my clattering tongue had been that familiar for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I guess she&rsquo;s just resting up a little in her room. She is bound to
      be nursing you most of the time, though you don&rsquo;t need so much attention,
      so far as I can see. Do you know, Ross, in spite of what you and I were
      saying to each other yesterday, that girl o&rsquo; mine still insists that your
      mind isn&rsquo;t right, and that you&rsquo;re off the hooks. She says there&rsquo;s
      something that hasn&rsquo;t come back to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      God bless that girl&rsquo;s intuition! I felt the tears coming into my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women folks are always seeing something a man can&rsquo;t see&mdash;because it
      isn&rsquo;t there for him to see!&rdquo; declared the captain. &ldquo;I have made her keep
      her mouth shut best I could! Nice thing it would be to have it go out in
      business circles that you&rsquo;re a lunatic. That old hippohampus uncle of
      yours would try to get himself appointed your guardian. He makes believe
      to be a great friend of yours, I know, when he calls, but I reckon he&rsquo;s
      only hiding that old grudge that Vose has told me about. <i>There&rsquo;s</i>
      your friend, Ross&mdash;Vose! He&rsquo;s the old boy to tie to!&rdquo; I was getting
      considerable information from Capt. Rask Hol-strom without weakening his
      confidence in my sanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, outside of Vose, it has really been a good thing for you to get
      back here near your girl,&rdquo; pursued the captain. &ldquo;Now you take Kama on that
      point! I say women folks have too much imagination. When you told me you
      wanted the Kingsley girl to stay away from you till you was fit to look
      at, why, then you was showing hard, ordinary common sense. In spite of all
      that Kama or anybody else said about her coming in here, I done just what
      you asked me to do&mdash;for I believe in men standing by each other. But,
      as I have told you, Kama was bound to have it that a screw was loose
      because you didn&rsquo;t want your girl first thing! And Kama has been bound and
      determined to hang on here till she is sure you&rsquo;re all right with your
      girl. But I can&rsquo;t see that your girl is in any great pucker about you! She
      hasn&rsquo;t showed up!&rdquo; The sweat started out on me. Into what sort of a tangle
      had my affairs been drawn?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got a good girl, even if she is flighty in her thoughts&mdash;as
      I suppose girls&rsquo; nature is about this lovey-dove business. I used to sit
      and hear you talk to her on the <i>Zizania</i> about those three rings and
      that girl back in Levant&mdash;all mush, mush right in the middle of that
      wind-up job&mdash;and, I swear, if I didn&rsquo;t think you were crazy then,
      though she wouldn&rsquo;t have it that way! Said you were all right. Kama and I
      never did seem to agree very well on much of anything. After the
      settlement with the underwriters, when you were right as a trivet and
      wanted to stay on the Coast, then she insisted that you were out of your
      head&mdash;as I don&rsquo;t mind telling you noe when we&rsquo;re going&mdash;and she
      fairly picked you up and lugged you back here. You were too sick to help
      yourself, you know! Made me help her do it! For you and your girl, said
      she! I ain&rsquo;t sure but what you <i>was</i> a little delirious there at
      times. But being here with Vose has done you good. However, I like West
      the best. So as I say, I reckon Kama and I will pack up and start back.
      Furthermore, you know, I&rsquo;m summonsed for that trial.&rdquo; I merely stared at
      the old gossiper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be too hard on those critters,&rdquo; he said, musingly. &ldquo;There
      was a big temptation and Marcena Keedy knew how to stir &rsquo;em up.
      When he lolloped that word &lsquo;gold&rsquo; around in his mouth he always made me
      drool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Didn&rsquo;t I remember, also? Only too well!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going to use some discretion in my testimony,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Rask chatted on. &ldquo;I have been running over in my mind what
      happened. Now, if you&rsquo;re a mind to, let me kind of rehearse it over to you
      so that you can check up my memory. I&rsquo;ll hate to have any law-sharks
      tangle me on the stand. If I make a slip catch me up on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assured him that I would, and I settled back in bed with great joy in my
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave me the most wonderful story I ever read or ever listened to&mdash;wonderful
      because it concerned myself, my friends, my hopes, and my fortune;
      wonderful, because I was in it, acted in it, and now for the first time
      was hearing what I had done. He droned out the hair-raising narrative
      without showing special interest in it, confident that I knew the
      happenings as well as he; at the most interesting point, in order to
      collect his thoughts in regard to Marcena Keedy, he stopped and pared and
      munched an apple; I was saving my own face in the matter and I did not
      dare to prod him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not minded to make much account of the details of that story. In this
      yarn I have been telling what I do know&mdash;not what I have heard from
      another man&rsquo;s lips. Let this much suffice: I recovered the rest of the <i>Golden
      Gate</i> treasure, so far as human knowledge of it went, the jettisoned
      gold was dragged for and raised, and then mutiny, which had been secretly
      organized by Keedy and the Finn, developed into a bloody battle which had
      been won against numbers by the rifles of the lawful guards. Keedy would
      not fight&mdash;he had prodded the other poor devils to do that&mdash;and
      the San Francisco men took the law into their hands when the <i>Zizania</i>
      was on the high seas and hung Keedy from the derrick boom. So, there&rsquo;s
      enough in a nutshell to make quite a book by itself!
    </p>
    <p>
      And then while Captain Rask meditatively wagged his jaws on another apple
      I lay and gnawed my nervous lips and wondered how much money I had in the
      world! I did not dare to ask questions. I felt as bitterly fearful as a
      straitened merchant who has lost all run of his bank credits and is afraid
      to ask his bank how he stands; the fear of giving one&rsquo;s self away becomes
      terror pretty vital!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, I&rsquo;m going to pass the rest of my days without worrying about
      their troubles,&rdquo; declared the captain, again clacking shut his knife
      blade. &ldquo;They brought it on themselves, though I shall swear on the stand
      that Keedy toled them into the scrape. You and I did right by the faithful
      ones&mdash;especially <i>you</i>, for you could give out a better line of
      talk&mdash;when we pulled that hundred thousand out of the underwriters
      and added it to the hundred thousand of our own. They&rsquo;re satisfied, even
      the Snohomish Glutton in his new restaurant, and Ingot Ike, who has gone
      to board with him. Clear consciences&mdash;that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got, Ross!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But how much clear profit? The fact that we had handed out one hundred
      thousand dollars was a consoling bit of information. There naturally must
      be plenty more where that came from!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do all the folks here&mdash;do the people in Levant know how well we&rsquo;re
      fixed?&rdquo; I faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! I ain&rsquo;t ashamed of it. Are you? I haven&rsquo;t let the yarn lose
      anything by the way I have told it. It has been a good way of killing
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So everybody else in Levant, except myself, knew how rich I was!
    </p>
    <p>
      And then that infernal old tiddlywhoop yawned, got up, and stamped out of
      the room, saying that he was going to stretch his legs. I didn&rsquo;t have
      spirit enough to stop him and ask the great question.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know just how wild I looked while I sat there, but I know I felt
      wild. Then Kama Holstrom came into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was conscious that my features were not obeying my volition. I had not
      been able to make that clacking tongue of mine behave; now my face was
      just as disobedient. I wanted with all my heart to beam gratitude and joy
      on her, but I seemed to be trying to manage a stiff mask. If she had
      turned and escaped in sheer fright I would not have blamed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I entirely mistook the expression on her face when she stood there and
      stared at me. Her eyes were wide with what appeared to be terror. Her lips
      parted and her cheeks grew pale. Then she ran to the side of the bed,
      plumped down on her knees, set both her little hands about one of mine and
      cried, &ldquo;Thank the good God! You have come back&mdash;you have come back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that&rsquo;s how a woman knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The balm of her tears bathed my hand when she put her forehead down and
      hid her face. It was not white any longer&mdash;the warm color flooded it
      and I ought to have been content for a time with what I could bring in the
      compass of my gaze. But I wanted to have a blessing from her eyes, and
      when I struggled to lift her face she suddenly released my hand and
      hurried to the window and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to make a fool of myself that way,&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;But when I
      saw your eyes I knew you had come back&mdash;and it has been so long&mdash;and
      the others haven&rsquo;t understood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I came to myself, just now, Kama, your father was here and I didn&rsquo;t
      confess to him. What I know now and what you have known all along we must
      keep to ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Nobody has believed what I was so sure of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We sat there in silence for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember?&rdquo; she asked, almost whispering the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only flashes. Not much. But your father has just been chatting on, and
      now I have the story without his realizing what news he was telling me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was the first to break another silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know from what he said how faithful and self-sacrificing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You force me to remind you how much we owe to you, sir. It makes me very
      uncomfortable. It&rsquo;s twitting me of a debt which father and I can never
      pay. Please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So there was conversation closed on that point; I did not feel like making
      Kama Holstrom uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all coming about just as it should. It will be all right from now
      on,&rdquo; she said, after a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had recovered all her usual serenity; she was the girl of the <i>Zizania</i>,
      cool and distant. I was irritated by her manner. That aloofness was not a
      square deal between folks who had been through what we had suffered
      together. It seemed to me that I was not being treated right&mdash;first
      that matter-of-fact manner of Captain Rask and now this coolness on the
      daughter&rsquo;s part. Her first greeting had given me an appetite for more of
      the same sort. Of course, I didn&rsquo;t expect to be welcomed back from the
      shadows with a brass band and speeches&mdash;but some kind of hankering or
      dissatisfaction was gnawing inside me and I felt ugly and cross and
      childish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t intended to go too far in anything, sir. But I have been so
      anxious to help all I could&mdash;forgive me, but father and I do owe you
      so much! Don&rsquo;t scowl so! I&rsquo;ll not mention debts again. I hope you won&rsquo;t
      think I was too eager&mdash;and that I meddled. But I went to her! I did
      not want her to misunderstand! It was due you and due myself&mdash;and
      her. So I have explained everything. I have told her the story. It will
      come about all right&mdash;just as you hope&mdash;I am sure! I did not
      intend to stay here&mdash;but I have been worrying about&mdash;But now you
      can speak for yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rattled it off so fast I couldn&rsquo;t get in a word. She looked relieved
      when she had finished&mdash;as if she had been carrying around something
      very disagreeable and had handed it over to somebody for keeps. And I was
      obliged to wait quite a while before I dared to trust myself to reply to
      her. What she had handed to me seemed to be about as gratifying as if she
      had dropped a sea-crab down the back of my neck and then sat back and
      expected me to give her three cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look-a-here!&rdquo; I yapped. &ldquo;Where did you get the notion that I wanted you
      or anybody else to act as my attorney over there?&rdquo; I jerked my thumb in
      the direction of the Kingsley house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your head was not right&mdash;I knew it,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;I was
      afraid there would be a misunderstanding&mdash;and after what you made me
      promise on the <i>Zizania</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that I was as crazy as a coot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I knew that deep down in your heart you must love her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A crazy man doesn&rsquo;t tell the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he does when he is revealing his real soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t revealing any soul. I was babbling away&mdash;and I knew I was
      talking fool talk and I couldn&rsquo;t stop my tongue. I didn&rsquo;t mean that guff.
      And now you have got this thing all tangled up by talking to Celene
      Kingsley. I can do my own love-making!&rdquo; That temper of mine was working in
      fine shape. And Kama Holstrom was no wilting daisy in temperament!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what I know of you myself, and what <i>others</i>&mdash;I call no
      names&mdash;have said, you are about as well qualified in that direction
      as a catfish.&rdquo; She jumped up and stamped her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I know now what love&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sidney, you have just insulted me because I tried to be your friend.
      And your <i>sweetheart</i>,&rdquo; she sneered, &ldquo;has no better manners than you!
      She has not even thanked me for bringing you to her! I do not understand!
      I shall go to her at once and tell her that you are in your right senses
      at last. After this you handle your own love affairs. Don&rsquo;t you mention
      the word &lsquo;love&rsquo; to me again!&rdquo; She marched out and banged the door so
      violently behind her that all the brass handles on the old high-boy were
      left jingling shrilly&mdash;as if the high-boy had gone into a spasm of
      giggles over my comeuppance!
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the kindly face of Dodovah Vose appeared at the door, his
      eyes full of solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fall out of bed?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, out of heaven,&rdquo; I snapped. He came in and shut the door and showed
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, son, you seem to have a turn for the worse all of a sudden.
      You&rsquo;ve been gaining fine. But your eyes look crazy to-day. And what you
      just said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Say, I came nigh bawling out Dodovah Vose, right then! Nobody seemed to
      know anything about my case except Kama Holstrom&mdash;and she knew too
      blamed much! I rolled myself out of bed and stood on my feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lawd!&rdquo; gasped my old friend, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t do that. It&rsquo;s against her
      orders. You&rsquo;re sartain out of your head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry one mite about my knob,&rdquo; I shouted, cracking my scarred
      knuckles against it&mdash;and the pain in the knuckles made me all the
      uglier. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be nursed and fussed over any longer. I have
      been nursed too much already. They&rsquo;re even nursing my own private business&mdash;and
      making it sicker all the time. From now on I&rsquo;m going to tend to my own
      affairs. Mr. Vose, help me get these bandages off my feet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood back and flapped his hands and protested. I knew he felt that I
      had become a lunatic, and so I convinced him by walking up and giving him
      a good, sane stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m going to stay in bed the rest of my life&mdash;a man who
      has so much to live for as I have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;a man who is wuth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last somebody was going to post me on my financial status&mdash;satisfy
      my wild eagerness to find out! And I stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; I fairly barked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be reminded of that every
      five minutes. Excuse me, Mr. Vose. But get my clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had made up my mind that only one voice in all the world should tell me
      what my sacrifice had wrung from the Pacific for my own self! Silly
      notion, eh? No matter. I felt that a certain pair of lips would bless the
      information when it passed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour later I was dressed after a fashion. I walked down-stairs, or
      it may be better to say that I scuffed and skated down, for I could not
      squeeze my feet into shoes and was provided with a pair of Dodovah Vose&rsquo;s
      slippers&mdash;carpet affairs with a hectic rose on each instep.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Captain Holstrom on the porch with my uncle Deck; their chairs
      were tipped back and they were confabbing in most amiable fashion. My
      uncle grinned at me, and I floundered for words because I wasn&rsquo;t sure what
      I had said to him prior to my awakening or just what our diplomatic
      relations were. His grin encouraged me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn it,&rdquo; he ejaculated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said right along it was best for you to be
      up and around. But Cap&rsquo;s girl would have it t&rsquo;other way. Feel all right,
      sonny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feel better, Uncle Deck, if I&rsquo;m sure that you and I will never have
      any more misunderstandings. As we have said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stopped there and waited, figuring that I had left about the right kind
      of an opening to find out what we <i>had</i> said. My uncle arose and
      clapped my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sonny, I tell you again, now when you stand man-fashion in front of me,
      that the night when I took my first trick at sitting up with you we fixed
      it all! For I found out how you felt, underneath, about <i>him!</i> And
      about the whole proposition!&rdquo; He nudged me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking my comfort these
      days watching him. No more liberty than old Potter Crabtree&rsquo;s
      clay-grinding hoss&mdash;around and around in an everlasting circle. I
      hope he&rsquo;ll live long enough to pay his debts&mdash;that means a
      considerable stretch of enjoyment for me. I wouldn&rsquo;t trig his wheel for
      all the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was how it stood, eh? And I let it stand, for I wasn&rsquo;t just sure what
      my private sentiments were in regard to Judge Kingsley at that time.
      Furthermore, I had some very special business of my own on my mind. I
      turned to Captain Rask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Kama?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon she&rsquo;s over saying good-by to your girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My uncle stared at me&mdash;I must have been telling him things when he
      sat up with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saying good-by! Then she probably had told her father that she was ready
      to go away. I started across the village square, sliding along in my huge
      slippers like a man walking on snow-shoes. I banged the big knocker on the
      front door of Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s mansion and the maid admitted me. I was not
      bashful that day&mdash;I walked right into the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I am any judge of expressions I did not interrupt any amiable and
      confidential tête-à-tête. The two girls rose and, after a few moments of
      constraint, Celene Kingsley asked me to be seated. I told her that I
      preferred to stand; I reckon that I wasn&rsquo;t sure that I <i>could</i> sit
      down; the stiffness of the whole situation made me feel as if I did not
      have any joints.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have finished my errand,&rdquo; declared Kama. The red was in her cheeks and
      there was no encouragement for me in her eyes. &ldquo;I will say, Mr. Sidney,
      that I have apologized to Miss Kingsley for meddling in matters between
      you two. I thought I understood and I have tried to help. I deserve
      exactly what I have received! I assure you both that I will keep out of
      the way after this.&rdquo; She started for the door, but I was standing where I
      could block her. I supplemented my interference by an appeal to the lady
      of the mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you ask Miss Holstrom to remain for a moment?&rdquo; I entreated. And Miss
      Holstrom did remain, biting her lower lip with impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had much time for thinking on what to say,&rdquo; I confessed. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know how to talk to ladies very well, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My face was flaming&mdash;I could hardly control my voice&mdash;I felt
      sure that I was committing a dreadful sin in point of etiquette and all
      that&mdash;but once more I was playing a big game in my life&mdash;bigger,
      even, for the sake of my happiness than when I offered to go down after
      the remainder of the treasure of the <i>Golden Gate</i>. I was operating
      again on human nature&mdash;and that nature was in the complex little
      personality of Kama Holstrom who pressed impatiently at my elbow, frowning
      at me. I knew with all my heart and soul that unless she stood in the
      presence of Celene Kingsley and myself&mdash;as she then stood&mdash;and
      heard the truth about my boyhood folly, my cause was lost; because the
      pride of a girl makes the way of a man with a maid a mighty doubtful
      proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I hope that you have found out that I am not the scoundrel you
      believed me to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the truth now. My father is wiser! I am trying to find words&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, just as if she did not know what she ought to say to me,
      and I could not blame her for feeling pretty uncertain. She looked at me
      with a sort of kindly and tolerant expression&mdash;but, good heavens,
      there wasn&rsquo;t any love in her eyes! I had found out what love-light was
      like when Kama Holstrom kneeled beside my bed that afternoon!
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have confessed and have shown, I was pretty much of a blunderer in
      affairs with women. But do me this credit in your estimate: I had not come
      into the presence of Celene Kingsley that day harboring any more illusions
      as to how I stood with her. I was awake! Think back with me! Never had she
      given me a word of affection. Rather, her tolerance of me had been plainly
      inspired by her zeal in her father&rsquo;s behalf. After that piece of brazen
      idiocy of mine, when I had taken her in my arms, she had been careful to
      keep out of my reach. Allow me to say that I had been doing some swift and
      coherent thinking on my way from the tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my soul was the shamed consciousness that I had been making a real
      thing out of a dream&mdash;and had been babbling unwarrantably. I was a
      pitiful object as I stood there between them&mdash;I deserved punishment
      at the hands of both of them. For I had made free with Celene Kingsley&rsquo;s
      name and had misdirected Kama Holstrom&rsquo;s devoted obedience to a promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say, I knew with all my heart and being that I had never struck a spark
      of real love from the condescending nature of Judge Kingsley&rsquo;s daughter; I
      knew that I loved Kama Holstrom with all the tender devotion one pours
      forth to the true mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I dared not say a word lest I should appear as an atrocious cad
      seeking release from the old love before taking on the new.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equally did Celene Kingsley&rsquo;s high-bred delicacy restrain her tongue; I
      understood that she did not want to betray me as a mere cheeky boaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we stood there looking at one another, three as unhappy specimens of
      humanity as there were in Levant that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am too much of a fool to know what to say and how to say it,&rdquo; I
      blurted, and the tears ran down my cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Celene who stepped into the breach; she wasn&rsquo;t in love, and she was
      cooler than the other two in the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked up to Kama and took her hands in caressing grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; faltered the poor girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped you could understand without obliging me to speak. I hoped you
      would guess when I refused to discuss certain matters with you&mdash;I
      made you angry, and I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I meddled&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I understood you all the time! I understood my old school
      friend, too!&rdquo; She reached out her hand and drew me close to Kama. &ldquo;He has
      been very noble in his help in a great trial in my family, dear! I owe my
      happiness to him. And I&rsquo;m speaking out, rather boldly&mdash;rather
      bluntly, because I want to help him in obtaining his great happiness. I
      know what must happen to make him happy.&rdquo; She put Kama&rsquo;s hand in mine.
      &ldquo;Now, my dear, do not force me to disparage one of the best young men I
      have ever known by telling you that I never dreamed of him as a husband&mdash;nor
      was I anything else to him except a school-day fancy, a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An inspiration to set me on the way to make something of myself,&rdquo; I
      insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now&mdash;say it, Ross Sidney, or you&rsquo;re a coward&mdash;say it, and
      let me hear it! She deserves it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found out that real love differs from boyhood fancies&mdash;and I&mdash;I&mdash;want
      to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gently pushed us toward the door while I was stammering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to tell a dear girl the sweetest story in the world, Ross
      Sidney! My blessing on you both. Good night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We did not speak to each other for some time after we were out of doors
      together. I took her arm in gentle manner and led her steps away from the
      tavern. We could see its lights in the early dusk, and I wanted to keep
      away from lights for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was glad the autumn dusk had settled&mdash;a sliver of new moon was a
      comforting sight for a lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess neither of us knows very well how to talk about love, Kama,&rdquo; I
      told her, hobbling along beside her as best I could. The judge&rsquo;s orchard
      was shaded by the evening&rsquo;s gloom, and when I turned down there she did
      not resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m mighty awkward about making love,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;but God knows
      I want to learn how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you think I can do any better as a tutor in love than as an
      attorney?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ll be such a willing pupil, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you inform Miss Kingsley with a great deal of earnestness just
      now that you have found out what real love is like.&rdquo; She couldn&rsquo;t keep all
      the naughty teasing from her tone, though her voice trembled. &ldquo;Who is the
      fortunate one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I caught her to me, and with her warm cheek close to mine and her
      lips near and never denying caresses, I told her and I convinced her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she admitted, after a long time and after many words there in
      the blessed shadows, &ldquo;that you are entitled to your diploma, Ross. You are
      showing me that you know more than your tutor. But is there a woman who is
      not jealous when she is in love? Here!&rdquo; She pressed into my hand a little
      packet; it contained the three rings. I drew her along to the cleft tree.
      I dropped them into the hollow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One for fancy, one for folly, one for the freakish dreams of boyhood!&rdquo; I
      told her. &ldquo;All buried! Come back to the tavern, precious girl! I want you
      to tell Dodovah Vose how to decorate the parlor for the wedding!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reached on tiptoe and plucked two apples from the old tree. She gave
      one to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An apple of gold from the only woman in the world,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;gold&rsquo; to me, Ross! Don&rsquo;t! A boy of your age with half a
      million safe in the bank&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was my news at last! I kissed the lips which told me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, eating the sweet fruit of our new knowledge of life and of each
      other, we went on our way up through the whispering trees toward the
      welcoming, glowing windows of the old tavern.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
